<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>You might see this as a headline (sometimes followed by an AR1 Middle East Scoring).  But unless it throws the US out of the region entirely, it is otherwise not a particularly good event, since the 2-3 influence is easily replaced.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Generally not much of a problem, since you replace the two influence lost with the two Ops of the card and give up on Lebanon temporarily.  It is only really annoying when Middle East Scoring is getting ready to be played, and the loss of Lebanon, even for a single Action Round, becomes meaningful.</p>
