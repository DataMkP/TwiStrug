<p>You can&#8217;t play Olympic Games for the event when DEFCON is at 2, because your opponent will boycott and you will lose on DEFCON.  Once you realize that, there&#8217;s not much else to see: if you play it when DEFCON is greater than 2, no sane opponent would ever boycott, and so you&#8217;re basically playing a 2Ops card for an average of 1.25VP.  Not a good trade in most circumstances, and in any event, if DEFCON is greater than 2, you should have much greater priorities than hosting the Olympics.</p>
<p>About its only use is as a headline (albeit a rather risky and ineffective one) if you have nothing else to headline, or when you&#8217;re truly desperate for VPs.  Remember that an Olympic Games headline can cause you to lose the game if your opponent also degrades DEFCON in the headline!</p>
<p>A pedantic footnote: in the Deluxe Edition, the wording of the card&#8217;s boycott clause was slightly changed.  The new wording (&#8220;as if they played a 4 Ops card&#8221; instead of &#8220;with 4 Operations points&#8221;) means that a Olympic Games boycott is now subject to Red Scare/Purge.  Not that it ever matters, but it helps clarify the boundaries of Red Scare/Purge, which is often the subject of rules questions.</p>
