<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 1<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p>Summit is one of the weakest cards in the game to draw.  For starters, it&#8217;s a 1 Op card: Nuclear Test Ban might be the worst event relative to its Ops, but no one is ever unhappy to draw it.</p>
<p>Worse, like Olympic Games, it has the strong possibility of losing you the game at DEFCON 2.  Although it is not a guaranteed DEFCON suicide card, you would be foolhardy indeed to play this at DEFCON 2 unless you had a massive lead in regions.</p>
<p>More commonly, because of its very low Ops value, you might headline it if there&#8217;s nothing else worth headlining and you&#8217;d rather conserve your Ops.  Alternatively, if you are absolutely desperate for VPs, Summit offers you the grim choice of a chance at 2VPs or nuclear annihilation.</p>
