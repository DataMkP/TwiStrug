<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>If you hadn&#8217;t drawn De-Stalinization or Decolonization, then Portuguese Empire Crumbles and South African Unrest are your primary non-coup ways to get into Africa.  The event can also sometimes flip Angola, but most US players will overcontrol 1-stability battlegrounds anyway (so you can&#8217;t just flip it with a 3 Ops).  And if you&#8217;re under Red Purge, the event&#8217;s text suddenly looks a lot better when the alternative is just 1 Op.</p>
<p>Outside of these situations I rarely play Portuguese Empire Crumbles for the event.  It&#8217;s the Angola influence that really matters, and if you needed 2 influence there you could just use the card&#8217;s Ops and keep the event in the deck.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Drawing Portuguese Empire Crumbles is not much of a problem.  The 2 Ops can easily be used to repair Angola, and who really cares about SE African States.  If the USSR isn&#8217;t in Africa, then I will consider spacing it, but if that&#8217;s the case then you should also be able to use the card&#8217;s Ops and control of Zaire/South Africa/Botswana to realign the Angola influence out.</p>
