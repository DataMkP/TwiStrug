<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the most important Early War card in the deck.  Without De-Stalinization, it will be very difficult to contest the Americas.  As such, no matter how tempting, I almost always try to use all of the influence from De-Stalinization into a Mid War region.  Occasionally I will put one into Thailand, if I need immediate access to it, but the card is best for fighting for the Mid War regions.</p>
<p>I also rarely headline this card, because it is a very risky card to have Defectored.  Moreover, you have to play this at DEFCON 2, so that the US doesn&#8217;t just coup out your influence immediately.</p>
<p>If you have Decolonization, then De-Stalinization is an easy choice: all four into the four South American battlegrounds.  If you don&#8217;t have Decolonization, I will tend to put a couple into Africa (perhaps Angola and Algeria), and the other two into South America (one in Venezuela and one in Argentina or Chile).  I don&#8217;t usually place it into Central America, because I can coup Panama, Fidel grants me Cuba, and Mexico is too easily realigned out.  More importantly, De-Stalinization into South America gives me more access than De-Stalinization into Central America.</p>
<p>Remember that The Voice of America is the perfect antidote to De-Stalinization, so be sure to fortify your position by the Mid War so that VoA cannot just remove all of your influence.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Like Decolonization, this is a hold-until-Turn-3 card.  Whether or not the USSR triggers this can be game-deciding, so spacing it on Turn 3 earns you a massive advantage.  By Turn 7, this card is mostly useless, and can be safely played for Operations.  But I would rather give up West Germany to a Blockade than play this in the Early War.</p>
<p>In many ways, De-Stalinization is like Puppet Governments, with the key difference being that it is guaranteed to be drawn by Turn 3, when it still matters.</p>
