<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 1<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>An unimportant event.  No decent US player contests Romania, and so this card is always played for Ops.  Occasionally it might be headlined, if you&#8217;re deathly afraid of Defectors and have nothing better to dump, or if you need a European non-battleground ASAP.</p>
<p>The only thing to keep an eye out for is Independent Reds.  You&#8217;ll almost always want to trigger Independent Reds first rather than give the US 3 influence in a country bordering the USSR.  This is especially true if Truman Doctrine is not out, since the US would have the option of playing to take Romania and +1VP each time Europe Scoring comes out.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to play this as soon as I can, so that Independent Reds can be merely situational instead of worthless.  Although the Romania Abdication/Independent Reds/Truman Doctrine combo is nice, it&#8217;s not worth it to pursue it on your own.  If you play Romanian Abdication, and the USSR plays Independent Reds later, then hey, why not Truman away the 3 influence for Romania.  But it&#8217;s otherwise not worth 3 Ops and 2 Action Rounds to score +1 VP on Europe Scoring.</p>
