<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>A lot like the US OPEC, with two very crucial differences: 1) Alliance for Progress is not recurring; 2) Alliance for Progress often starts off scoring very low, but almost always scores quite high by the end of the game.</p>
<p>It is therefore almost always an autoplay if I draw it early in the Mid War and the US doesn&#8217;t have many battlegrounds.  But if they already control more than 2, I&#8217;ll just send it to space and hope that I draw it again later and can space it again.  (Remember that like all discards, it is better discarded on Turn 7 than Turn 6.)  If unable to space it, you can just use the Ops to break control of at least one of the US battlegrounds first.</p>
<p>One of the best uses of this card is as your AR1 coup.  Trigger the event after your coup, and oh, what&#8217;s this, I happened to coup away your only Latin American battleground.  How unfortunate &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>The reverse of the USSR analysis holds: if this can&#8217;t score you 3 or more VPs, play it for Ops and trigger it in the Late War for more.  Once it gets to 3+ VPs, I tend to prepare to trigger it lest the USSR draw it in the Late War.</p>
