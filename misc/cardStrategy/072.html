<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 1<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Another in a long line of annoying, unspaceable US Mid War 1 Op cards.  Coupled with Camp David Accords, Sadat gives Egypt to the US, throwing a wrench in your Middle East Scoring or OPEC plans.  But you don&#8217;t really have any other options &#8212; sometime in the Mid War, Sadat almost certainly will be triggered.  So it&#8217;s better to plan for him in advance: if the US breaks control of Egypt with Camp David Accords, I don&#8217;t bother reinforcing it if I&#8217;m going to be expelled by Sadat soon afterwards.</p>
<p>For the most part Sadat can be effectively neutralized by keeping either Nasser or Muslim Revolution in the deck.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>This is a great event if the USSR controls Egypt, and almost always worth triggering.  It is better to play Camp David Accords first, then Sadat, to keep the Sword of <del>Damocles </del>Sadat hanging over the USSR&#8217;s head.</p>
