<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>The damage is easily repaired, but the loss of Muslim Revolution is not.  Given that this is essentially a 1 Op card if you control Saudi Arabia, I will only play it if Muslim Revolution or Middle East Scoring is not going to be reshuffled into the deck.  (Or if I have more important things to send to Space, which I probably do.)</p>
<p>If the US controls Saudi Arabia already, then I usually play this without a second thought since it doesn&#8217;t affect the scoring of the region.  (Though Muslim Revolution might be just what you need to win back the Middle East.)</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>There are four possible scenarios:</p>
<p>If Muslim Revolution is still in the deck and the USSR controls Saudi Arabia, this is a very good event with two positive benefits.</p>
<p>If Muslim Revolution isn&#8217;t in the deck and the USSR controls Saudi Arabia, AWACS depends on on whether you possibly wresting control (which would involve at least 4 Ops after AWACS) is really worth it to you.  Does it affect Domination scoring, or just the battleground&#8217;s VP?</p>
<p>If Muslim Revolution is still in the deck but I control Saudi Arabia, this is an OK event since Muslim Revolution is guaranteed to take out at least 5 influence. But I am probably willing to chance it and just play AWACS for Ops.</p>
<p>If Muslim Revolution isn&#8217;t in the deck and I control Saudi Arabia, then there is definitely no point to wasting the 3 Ops.</p>
