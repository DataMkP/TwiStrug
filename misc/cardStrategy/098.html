<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>A phenomenal headline.  In some ways it is even stronger than the original Aldrich Ames (see below): Aldrich Ames Remix still retains DEFCON win possibilities (it is usually an instant win if the US is holding Lone Gunman), and even if you don&#8217;t get to win by DEFCON, you do get to discard the best US event in their hand (ideally a scoring card) and see the US hand for the rest of the turn.  All in all, it makes Aldrich Ames Remix one of the best USSR headlines in the Late War, especially since it&#8217;s almost impossible to backfire or be mitigated.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>This is typically painless if you play it in your last action round, and in fact is probably a boon as you can use it to discard a strong USSR card (or even a bad scoring card), reminiscent of the USSR Five Year Plan trick.  It is not advisable to play Aldrich Ames Remix before your last action round.</p>
<p><strong>Aldrich Ames Original</strong></p>
<p>The original version of Aldrich Ames, included in pre-Deluxe Editions of the game, is a 4 Ops USSR starred event with the following text:</p>
<blockquote><p>US player must display his/her hand. USSR player then orders the US player&#8217;s cards.  US player must play hand in that order.  US player may not play The China Card for the rest of this turn.</p>
