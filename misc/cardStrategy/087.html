<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>An outstanding event.  The standard effect is very strong (like Ussuri River Skirmish), and the enhanced effect is irreparable in a single Action Round.</p>
<p>The Reformer can be used either on offense, defense, or both.  It defends against the US Late War incursion into Eastern Europe, and it can place a significant amount of influence into the Western European battlegrounds.  West Germany is probably too difficult to flip because of its stability, but Italy and France are both vulnerable.  Plus, you can dump extra influence into US non-battlegrounds and break/gain Domination (and in the case of Canada, pause NORAD).</p>
<p>That being said, do not hold this too long waiting for that negative VP score, as otherwise the US might draw and be able to play Glasnost as a -2VP ABM Treaty.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Send Mr. Gorbachev to space, every time.  Improving Glasnost is very bad for you, and adding 4-6 influence with only 3 Ops to counter is problematic as well.</p>
