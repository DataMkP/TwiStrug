<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Along with <a href="#/card/107" title="The USSR may perform a Coup Attempt, using this card’s Operations value, against a non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa. The USSR may perform a second Coup Attempt, against a different non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa, if the first Coup Attempt removed any US Influence from the target country.">Che</a>, Iran-Contra Scandal is one of the most underrated events in the game.  The reason it is so powerful (compared to <a href="#/card/69" title="All of the phasing player’s Coup Attempts in Central and South America, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their die roll. All of the opponent’s Coup Attempts in Central and South America, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their die roll.">Latin American Death Squads</a>) is that the modifier applies to all US realignment rolls, including their rolls on your realignments.  So it&#8217;s not a speculative event: you headline it and then go nuts realigning the US in the Mid War regions.  Suddenly, now that even rolls are favorable, it is a lot easier to find good realignment targets.  No need to hold onto both Colombia and Brazil to realign Venezuela any more; just one of the two will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Play it on your last Action Round, though you can sometimes get away with playing it merely very late if the USSR doesn&#8217;t have time to set up a realignment.</p>
