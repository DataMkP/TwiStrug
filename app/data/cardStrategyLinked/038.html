<p><strong>Time: </strong>Mid War<br />
<strong>Battlegrounds</strong>: 1<br />
<strong>Countries</strong>: 7</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>General Considerations</strong></p>
<p>The main contested countries in the Early War are Burma, Laos/Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand.  The USSR almost always ends up with control of Vietnam, while the US almost always has 1 in Malaysia and 1 in the Philippines by the end of the Early War, leaving the USSR loath to fight for either.  By the Mid War, Burma will be sewn up, and then it&#8217;s a fight for the 1-stability countries, and of course, Thailand, a 4VP swing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Early War</strong></p>
<p>Since Asia is probably the most fought-over region in the Early War, Southeast Asia can&#8217;t help but get dragged into the fight.  Thailand is obviously of critical importance, but both sides also have an interest in taking Laos/Cambodia (limit access from Southeast Asia into western Asia) and Burma (ditto, plus <a href="#/card/24" title="India invades Pakistan or vice versa (player’s choice). Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every enemy controlled country adjacent to the target of the invasion (India or Pakistan). On a modified die roll of 4-6, the player receives 2 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 2 to its Military Operations Track.">Indo-Pakistani War</a> modifiers).  Malaysia is not frequently contested, since it&#8217;s more of a stepping stone to Thailand, nor are the Philippines, but Indonesia often gets a little visit from <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>.</p>
<p>Usually the US ends up doing better in the region, but <a href="#/card/9" title="Add 2 USSR Influence to Vietnam. For the remainder of the turn, the USSR receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of a card that uses all its Operations in Southeast Asia.">Vietnam Revolts*</a> and/or an early <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a> will usually sew it up pretty securely for the USSR.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you will see an Early War Asia fight that boils down to total country count, and here you&#8217;ll see one side (usually the US) down battlegrounds but able to deny Domination by controlling lots of Southeast Asia countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Mid War</strong></p>
<p>The battle for Southeast Asia is usually already decided in the Early War.  As the USSR, try to play Southeast <a href="#/card/1" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: 9; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Asia Scoring</a> before the US can spare Ops to secure Malaysia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The main fight will be over Thailand, easily the most valuable country, amplified by the fact that this will also affect <a href="#/card/1" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: 9; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Asia Scoring</a> as a whole.  Expect <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a>, <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a> (if used at DEFCON 3), <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a>, and <a href="#/card/76" title="If the USSR has the “#6 – The China Card” card, the USSR must give the card to the US (face up and available for play). If the US already has the “#6 – The China Card” card, add a total of 4 US Influence to any countries in Asia (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">Ussuri River Skirmish*</a> to all play a role in deciding Thailand&#8217;s fate.</p>
<p><strong>Late War</strong></p>
<p>No Late War event explicitly targets Southeast Asia, and more to the point, Southeast <a href="#/card/1" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: 9; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Asia Scoring</a> is usually no longer in the deck.</p>
