<p><strong>Time: </strong>Mid War<br />
<strong>Battlegrounds</strong>: 5<br />
<strong>Countries</strong>: 18<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>General Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Although theoretically lower-scoring than Europe or Asia, Africa Scoring is in practice often much more important.  Africa&#8217;s Early and Mid War events are much more powerful, and therefore lopsided scorings are more common.  It is very unusual for Europe to score more than 5VP for either side, but it is not at all unusual for one side to gain Africa Control and score 10 or 11VP.</p>
<p>The key theme of Africa is its low stability.  It has all three of the map&#8217;s 1-stability battlegrounds, meaning they are quite susceptible to being couped or even direct influence placement—it only takes a 3 Ops to flip control of a 1-stability battleground.  Overcontrol is therefore highly recommended in Nigeria / Zaire / Angola.</p>
<p>Given the lopsided scoring potential and low stabilities, it should be no surprise that Africa tends to be one of the &#8220;hottest&#8221; regions on the board.  As Jason Matthews noted, this accurately echoes the historical Cold War reality:</p>
<blockquote><p>Africa has a disproportionate number of battlegrounds, but that was reflective of a stark reality—there was no other continent where the Superpowers played so frequently or so freely as Africa. You can make a case for Asia, but there the powers needed to play carefully. In Africa, it was a no-holds-barred game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Africa's battlegrounds are conceptually divided into three regions: Algeria, Nigeria, and Zaire/Angola/South Africa.  They are separated by volatile, easily-couped non-battlegrounds.  The most important non-battleground is Botswana: it plays a central role in potential realignments against Angola and South Africa.  A player trying to break into this subregion must account for the ample realignment opportunities down there, since it is very easy to get realigned out and have no way back in.</p>
<p>Morocco presents another interesting non-battleground, as it is the only non-battleground that offers meaningful stability.  If you are desperate to score Domination and cannot afford to spend time couping back and forth, then Morocco may be the non-battleground you need.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Early War</strong></p>
<p>The US starts in South Africa and should, before the end of the Early War, move out into Angola and then Zaire.  This is because if the USSR successfully takes Angola first, then it will also nab Zaire while trapping the US in South Africa, leaving it vulnerable to a realignment from Angola and Botswana.  If the Soviets get into France, the US should look to claim Algeria first if it has influence in France: Algeria is a costly 2 Ops, but it is one of the most difficult battlegrounds to flip in Africa.</p>
<p>The USSR's primary entry point into Africa is <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>.  Algeria can be infiltrated through Soviet presence in France, and of course if the US does take Angola/Zaire, the USSR can coup into those countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Mid War</strong></p>
<p>Many Mid War events directly or indirectly target Africa.  The USSR has:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/card/52" title="Add 2 USSR Influence to Angola and the SE African States.">Portuguese Empire Crumbles*</a>
<ul>
<li>An easy way to secure a non-battleground and possibly flip Angola.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/53" title="The USSR either adds 2 Influence to South Africa or adds 1 Influence to South Africa and 2 Influence to a single country adjacent to South Africa.">South African Unrest</a>
<ul>
<li>A nice recurring event that can get you into a subregion if you are locked out.  The 1 influence in South Africa and 2 in a neighbor is usually the better choice, since it can flip Angola if it is not overcontrolled or take Botswana.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>
<ul>
<li>The Early War Decolonization establishes you access; the Mid War Decolonization can de-stabilize a whole series of battlegrounds, or grab a ton of non-battlegrounds to deny Domination.  It's extra-powerful because of all the low-stability battlegrounds.  Ideally you will have played this twice by the time Colonial Rear Guards comes out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/107" title="The USSR may perform a Coup Attempt, using this card’s Operations value, against a non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa. The USSR may perform a second Coup Attempt, against a different non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa, if the first Coup Attempt removed any US Influence from the target country.">Che</a>
<ul>
<li>Being able to coup two non-battlegrounds at once is a gamechanger: a US player might move towards Nigeria by playing into Cameroon and Saharan States simultaneously, figuring that even if you coup one of those countries they can still make it into Nigeria.  Che is the perfect counter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">The US has:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/card/66" title="The US may add 1 Influence to 3 countries that do not contain Influence from either the US or USSR.">Puppet Governments*</a>
<ul>
<li>If played early enough, this serves as a psuedo-<a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>.  In Africa, this can usually get to Nigeria without having to go through coupable non-battlegrounds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a>
<ul>
<li>If you have a hand conducive to it, Nuclear Subs will essentially win you every African 1-stability battleground by allowing you to freely coup away.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/63" title="Add 1 US Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Colonial Rear Guards</a>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>, though the fact that it comes out in the Mid War instead of the Early War hurts a lot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/74" title="Remove 4 USSR Influence from any countries NOT in Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">The Voice of America</a>
<ul>
<li>Although it can target any non-European country in the world, it is particularly effective in Africa because it offers the potential to eliminate the USSR's presence in certain subregions of Africa.  Unlike most other regions, it is difficult to move between African subregions, and so therefore it is much easier to deny entire swaths of battlegrounds to the USSR.  Can be followed up nicely with <a href="#/card/66" title="The US may add 1 Influence to 3 countries that do not contain Influence from either the US or USSR.">Puppet Governments*</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus of the Mid War shifts according to the timing of the Scoring Cards, but in general Africa takes high priority due to its high scoring potential and volatile low stability.</p>
<p><strong>Late War</strong></p>
<p>No new event targets Africa in the Late War.  Nevertheless, it continues to be a hot spot in the Late War for the same reasons as before.  Many of the key Africa events are recurring (in particular, <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a> / <a href="#/card/63" title="Add 1 US Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Colonial Rear Guards</a>) and can be a nasty Turn 10 surprise.</p>
