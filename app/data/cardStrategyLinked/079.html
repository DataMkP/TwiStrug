<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>General Considerations</strong></p>
<p>Although theoretically lower-scoring than Europe or Asia, Africa Scoring is in practice often much more important.  Africa&#8217;s Early and Mid War events are much more powerful, and therefore lopsided scorings are more common.  It is very unusual for Europe to score more than 5VP for either side, but it is not at all unusual for one side to gain Africa Control and score 10 or 11VP.</p>
<p>The key theme of Africa is its low stability.  It has all three of the map&#8217;s 1-stability battlegrounds, meaning they are quite susceptible to being couped or even direct influence placement—it only takes a 3 Ops to flip control of a 1-stability battleground.  Overcontrol is therefore highly recommended in Nigeria / Zaire / Angola.</p>
<p>Given the lopsided scoring potential and low stabilities, it should be no surprise that Africa tends to be one of the &#8220;hottest&#8221; regions on the board.  As Jason Matthews noted, this accurately echoes the historical Cold War reality:</p>
<blockquote><p>Africa has a disproportionate number of battlegrounds, but that was reflective of a stark reality—there was no other continent where the Superpowers played so frequently or so freely as Africa. You can make a case for Asia, but there the powers needed to play carefully. In Africa, it was a no-holds-barred game.</p>
