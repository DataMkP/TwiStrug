<p>I almost always space Bear Trap.  Note the crucial difference between Bear Trapping yourself and being Bear Trapped: when the US Bear Traps you, you usually just get out on the first discard, and nothing of value was lost.  But when you Bear Trap yourself, you <em>guarantee </em>the US at least one set of back-to-back Actions, and possibly more.  (Note also that when you Bear Trap yourself, the US gets to know in advance when you will be emerging from the Bear Trap.)  There are simply too many things a strong US can do to you with a set of back-to-back Actions to risk self-Bear-Trapping.</p>
<p>There are exceptions however.  Sometimes you have too many problematic US events in hand and the Bear Trap discard is the only way to escape.  This is considerably more common than a US player needing to self-<a href="#/card/42" title="On the US’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#106 – NORAD” Event (if applicable).">Quagmire*</a>, but still somewhat rare.  A better instance is when your last two cards are <a href="#/card/26" title="The USSR reveals their hand of cards for this turn. The US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">CIA Created*</a> and Bear Trap and you can&#8217;t hold a card; here, Bear Trapping yourself is the only way to avoid DEFCON suicide, because by skipping your Action Round with nothing to discard, you are &#8220;holding&#8221; <a href="#/card/26" title="The USSR reveals their hand of cards for this turn. The US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">CIA Created*</a> to next turn.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Bear Trap has two main uses.</p>
<p>The first is to hope that the USSR rolls really poorly and gets stuck in the Bear Trap for an extended period of time.  If they fail their rolls, you get to conduct back-to-back Actions, one of the Holy Grails of Twilight Struggle.  The benefit of consecutive Actions is almost always immense: it can let you flip a battleground, get into an otherwise inaccessible region, set up a vital realignment, score a region undeservedly advantageously by temporarily breaking control, or a whole host of other possibilities.</p>
<p>Of course, the odds are against you.  If you play Bear Trap and they successfully discard and roll, then nothing has really been accomplished, except you gave up a nice US event and probably so did they.</p>
<p>The real point of this is when you can tilt the odds towards you with <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>.  Timed correctly, you can deprive your opponent of many Action Rounds in a row, and as a bonus, strand them with low Ops cards that they must hold in hand for next round.  For example, if you headline <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>, and then spring Bear Trap halfway through the turn, they might have no 3+ Ops events left.  In that case, not only can they not discard to Bear Trap and be forced to skip a whole bunch of Actions (allowing you <em>carte blanche</em> to take over the world), those low Ops cards stay in their hand through next turn as well.  (If you are really lucky or sadistic, you can use <a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a> or the luck of the reshuffle to grab another copy of <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a> to do it all over again next turn &#8230;)</p>
<p>The second is to time Bear Trap so as to force the USSR to skip a crucial round.  For example, you can play it as an AR7 play or headline, which causes the USSR to skip their AR1.  This is not really as nice as when the USSR headlines <a href="#/card/42" title="On the US’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#106 – NORAD” Event (if applicable).">Quagmire*</a> on you, though.</p>
<p>In general Bear Trap is worse than <a href="#/card/42" title="On the US’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#106 – NORAD” Event (if applicable).">Quagmire*</a>.  It doesn&#8217;t cancel <a href="#/card/106" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country containing US Influence, at the end of each Action Round, if Canada is US-controlled and the DEFCON level moved to 2 during that Action Round. This Event is canceled by the “#42 – Quagmire” Event.">NORAD*</a>, there are fewer &#8220;timing&#8221; opportunities for the US to play it, and there are more US events for the USSR to discard.  Accordingly, I usually hold Bear Trap as US until I draw it with <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>, or some kind of opportunity presents itself.  And if I still don&#8217;t have <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a> by Turn 6 I will just play it for Ops, so the USSR at least has a chance of drawing it in the Turn 7 reshuffle.  Without <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>, you would much rather add this to the USSR headache list than play it yourself.</p>
