<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Almost always worth spacing as the USSR, since it adds 4 influence to low-stability countries and you only have 2 influence with which to respond.  Along with <a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a>, it can flip a USSR-controlled Africa to capitalism very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Identical to and yet weaker than <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>, Colonial Rear Guards doesn&#8217;t usually come out fast enough to lock up Africa or Southeast Asia.  But it&#8217;s still a very strong event: it can be used as a destabilizing headline or AR7 play if the USSR controls Africa and Southeast Asia.  If I don&#8217;t have immediate use for it, I tend to hold it or use it for overprotection insurance influence rather than the 2 Ops.</p>
<p>Normally the influence from this will be dumped into Africa, since Southeast Asia should no longer be very contested.  But I usually put at least one into Thailand (to threaten a China Card takeover), and then perhaps some into Philippines / Malaysia / Indonesia if Southeast Asia will be scored soon and those countries are still uncontrolled.  But the influence usually goes much farther in the 1-stability African battlegrounds.</p>
