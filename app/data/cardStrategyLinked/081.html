<p><strong>Time: </strong>Mid War<br />
<strong>Battlegrounds</strong>: 4<br />
<strong>Countries</strong>: 10</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>General Considerations</strong></p>
<p>South America offers the potential for some of the most lopsided scoring in the game.  With only 4 battlegrounds, closely-linked, it is the easiest region to gain Control over.  In particular, a great many USSR Mid War victories can be attributed to a <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a> into South America that locks up the four battlegrounds early.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t gain control, the difference between a 2-2 battleground deadlock and a 3-1 Domination is 5VP.  This is equal to a typical Europe Domination, and further suggests that along with Africa, South America is one of the key regions of the board.</p>
<p>The eventual trend of the continent is to tilt towards the United States.  The USSR must rely on either <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>, coups, or neutral events in the Mid War, while the US has a plethora of events (including <a href="#/card/70" title="Add a total of 2 US Influence to any countries in Central or South America.">OAS Founded*</a>, one of the most irritating 1 Ops events in the game).  Accordingly, it is important for a USSR that did manage to De-Stalinize into South America to lock up the region securely, so as to defend against an eventual US onslaught.</p>
<p>South America is also rife with potential for realignments, as it is the only region where every battleground can be subject to an easy realignment.  Common scenarios include Chile/Uruguay realigning Argentina, Colombia/Brazil realigning Venezuela, Venezuela/Uruguay realigning Brazil, and Peru/Argentina realigning Chile.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Early War</strong></p>
<p>The USSR has the easier job of getting into South America, but if and only if he draws <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>.  If he does, then South America control should be easy; otherwise, the USSR&#8217;s only hope is to attack the US with coups and events.</p>
<p>The US has only one Early War option for South America, and that&#8217;s the AR7 play into Colombia (AR6 in this case, since this is the Early War).  Personally, I&#8217;m not a fan of this move.  As USSR, I&#8217;m totally happy to just coup Colombia and give up a battleground coup; usually, in the Early War, the US is not terribly interested in battleground coups anyway, and certainly not at the cost of letting the USSR into South America with a strong Colombia coup.  On the other hand, if the USSR is already in South America thanks to <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>, then the AR7 play into Colombia is still unlikely to succeed but at least has little downside.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Mid War</strong></p>
<p>Many Mid War events directly or indirectly target South America.  The USSR, however, has very few options, with its only events being:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/card/54" title="Add 2 USSR Influence to Chile.">Allende*</a>
<ul>
<li>A good desperation way to get into South America if <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a> has not come out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/107" title="The USSR may perform a Coup Attempt, using this card’s Operations value, against a non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa. The USSR may perform a second Coup Attempt, against a different non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa, if the first Coup Attempt removed any US Influence from the target country.">Che</a>
<ul>
<li>A nice way of responding to two threats at once, creating two threats at once, or responding to one and creating your own simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:left;">The US has:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/card/66" title="The US may add 1 Influence to 3 countries that do not contain Influence from either the US or USSR.">Puppet Governments*</a>
<ul>
<li>If played early enough, this serves as a psuedo-<a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>, perfect if South America is still empty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/64" title="Add 1 US Influence to Panama, Costa Rica and Venezuela.">Panama Canal Returned*</a>
<ul>
<li>A straightforward way to get into Venezuela, very useful as an AR7 play or to get into an empty South America</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a>
<ul>
<li>Although not as persuasive as in Africa, <a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a> offers the US a rare opportunity at multiple battleground coups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/70" title="Add a total of 2 US Influence to any countries in Central or South America.">OAS Founded*</a>
<ul>
<li>A total pain for the USSR to deal with, and a good way to get into an empty South America (though make sure DEFCON is at 2, lest you get couped out immediately).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/78" title="The US receives 1 VP for each US controlled Battleground country in Central and South America.">Alliance for Progress*</a>
<ul>
<li>The &#8220;US <a href="#/card/61" title="The USSR receives 1 VP for Control of each of the following countries: Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Gulf States, Venezuela. This Event cannot be used after the “#86 – North Sea Oil” Event has been played.">OPEC</a>&#8221;.  Usually, however, it&#8217;s not worth very much when it first comes out; better to let it stew and collect more points in the Late War.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/74" title="Remove 4 USSR Influence from any countries NOT in Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">The Voice of America</a>
<ul>
<li>Extremely effective at eliminating the USSR from subregions of South America, especially as Venezuela and Brazil are both 2-stability countries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, the USSR will hope to draw these neutral events:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a></li>
<li><a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a></li>
<li><a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a>
<ul>
<li>The Holy Trinity of Mid War neutral events, with each serving its own purpose: <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a> attacks isolated battlegrounds, without regard for overcontrol; <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a> is a flexible card that allows you to either get access to a region, create realignment opportunities, or coup in the headline phase; and <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a> is &#8230; well, it&#8217;s a 4Ops battleground coup!  What more could you ask?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/69" title="All of the phasing player’s Coup Attempts in Central and South America, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their die roll. All of the opponent’s Coup Attempts in Central and South America, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their die roll.">Latin American Death Squads</a>
<ul>
<li>This is usually a non-factor, since it&#8217;s mainly useful on non-battlegrounds, and South America does not feature many non-battleground coups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the USSR did not draw <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>, and did not draw the neutral events to contest South America, then coups are their only real chance to contest the continent, and absent extraordinary luck they are probably going to break even at best on the region.</p>
<p>In the Mid War, the region can change hands surprisingly quickly.  Realignments are a key aspect to controlling South America: a US player that controls Colombia/Venezuela/Brazil/Uruguay, with no Soviet influence in any of those four countries, will be very difficult to knock out.</p>
<p>In general, Venezuela tends to be the most contested country, for two reasons: it scores on <a href="#/card/61" title="The USSR receives 1 VP for Control of each of the following countries: Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Gulf States, Venezuela. This Event cannot be used after the “#86 – North Sea Oil” Event has been played.">OPEC</a>, and Colombia is somewhat difficult to hold onto long enough to realign Venezuela.</p>
<p>South America is a region where consecutive plays are critical: taking over a battleground often involves two steps, and so it&#8217;s a one of the most tense regions on the board, as you and your opponent jockey in attempts to set up a critical realign.  This is why <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a> and <a href="#/card/107" title="The USSR may perform a Coup Attempt, using this card’s Operations value, against a non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa. The USSR may perform a second Coup Attempt, against a different non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa, if the first Coup Attempt removed any US Influence from the target country.">Che</a> are such strong events: <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a> lets you prepare for and realign in a single Action Round, and <a href="#/card/107" title="The USSR may perform a Coup Attempt, using this card’s Operations value, against a non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa. The USSR may perform a second Coup Attempt, against a different non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa, if the first Coup Attempt removed any US Influence from the target country.">Che</a> allows the USSR to do two things at once, be it respond to a threat or create one of their own.</p>
<p><strong>Late War</strong></p>
<p>In the Late War, the USSR gets a little help in the way of events, and the US must rely on their continued Mid War events:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#/card/83" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to Argentina and remove all USSR Influence from the United Kingdom. The US receives 1 VP. This Event prevents the “#7 – Socialist Governments” card from being played as an Event.">The Iron Lady*</a>
<ul>
<li>In theory a US event, but in practice a USSR event.  The loss of <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a> hurts a little, but being able to flip Argentina is more than worth it.  It should go without saying that the UK effect is worthless.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="#/card/95" title="The US must immediately discard a card with an Operations value of 3 or more or the USSR may double the amount of USSR Influence in 2 countries in South America.">Latin American Debt Crisis</a>
<ul>
<li>As US, I usually prefer to just let this trigger and not discard.  As USSR, it is a good way of pressuring the US by either making them give up a high Ops card or dramatically altering the situation in the region.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
