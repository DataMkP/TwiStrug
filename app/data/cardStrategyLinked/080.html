<p>There are a couple of uses for this card.  The most common is to leapfrog onto the 2/0 VP space to claim the 2VPs for yourself; then this event is like a 4VP swing (maybe adjusted for space race luck?) and worth it.  You can also stop an opponent from peeking at your headline, and occasionally be able to jump ahead to the 3/1 VP space (even more useful than the 2/0 space).  In general it is more effective the later it is played, like <a href="#/card/18" title="Move the Space Race Marker ahead by 1 space.">Captured Nazi Scientist*</a>.</p>
<p>It is best played when you are exactly one space behind your opponent, so that you can reap the benefit of the slot you are jumping to.  Occasionally it is worth it to jump to the peek-at-headline space when you are two boxes behind your opponent, but ideally you&#8217;d space something first, and then use One Small Step to get the 3/1 VP bonus too.</p>
<p>One Small Step is often also a hidden source of VPs.  Among experienced players that try to keep track of what cards can still award VPs in the Late War, One Small Step is commonly forgotten.</p>
<p>The great danger One Small Step poses (like <a href="#/card/18" title="Move the Space Race Marker ahead by 1 space.">Captured Nazi Scientist*</a>) is that you could leap too far forward and no longer be able to space 2Ops cards.  This is especially a problem for the USSR, who would love to peek at your headline, but perhaps not if she can no longer send <a href="#/card/67" title="The US randomly selects 1 card from the USSR’s hand (if available). The US must either play the card or return it to the USSR. If the card is returned, or the USSR has no cards, the US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Grain Sales to Soviets</a> and <a href="#/card/74" title="Remove 4 USSR Influence from any countries NOT in Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">The Voice of America</a> to space.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are ahead on the space race, then none of this matters and it&#8217;s just 2 Ops.</p>
<p>Incidentally I don&#8217;t really understand why this isn&#8217;t starred.  Perhaps if you play it for a second time, you are going to Mars.</p>
