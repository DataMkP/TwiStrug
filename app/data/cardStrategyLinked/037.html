<p><strong>Time: </strong>Mid War<br />
<strong>Battlegrounds</strong>: 3<br />
<strong>Countries</strong>: 10</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>General Considerations</strong></p>
<p>If I had to pick one region to ignore, I&#8217;d probably pick Central America.  Not that it isn&#8217;t important, but by definition, one of the regions has to be the least important, and that region is usually Central America.  Domination is a measly 2VP bonus, meaning that Dominations usually score at +3VP for the US, and it&#8217;s very difficult to hold onto Domination because almost all the non-battlegrounds are so volatile and low-stability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the region&#8217;s main role in the game is a point source for the USSR.  In general, the USSR is going to benefit a lot more from Central America scoring because Mexico/Cuba essentially score double.  And although the US theoretically has easier access to those battlegrounds, <a href="#/card/8" title="Remove all US Influence from Cuba. USSR adds sufficient Influence in Cuba for Control.">Fidel*</a> in practice often sews up Cuba for the USSR, and an early game coup of Panama can leave the Gulf of Mexico feeling very communist indeed.</p>
<p>Central America does offer the potential for one of the easiest Dominations in the game.  As US, a fortified Panama with control of Costa Rica can easily keep the USSR out of the region and allow an easy +4VP.  More commonly, both sides get into the region, and one country will control two battlegrounds, while the other tries to take a lot of non-battlegrounds to stop Domination.</p>
<p>The USSR often ends up with difficulty getting out of Cuba; without a coup or <a href="#/card/75" title="Add a total of 3 USSR Influence to any countries in Central America (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">Liberation Theology</a>, they don&#8217;t really have a shot at Panama or Mexico from Cuba.  In addition, Cuba and Mexico are extremely vulnerable to US realignment, made all the more volatile by their adjacent 1-stability realignment-modifying non-battlegrounds.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Early War</strong></p>
<p>The USSR has <strong><a href="#/card/8" title="Remove all US Influence from Cuba. USSR adds sufficient Influence in Cuba for Control.">Fidel*</a></strong>, which is a pretty easy route into Cuba.  Although theoretically <strong><a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a></strong> could place influence here, it is not worth it: Panama is more easily couped, Mexico is easily realigned, and Cuba is likely yours anyway.</p>
<p>The US rarely plays here in the Early War.  Once in a while you might shore up Panama, or add an influence into Costa Rica, but otherwise that&#8217;s that.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Mid War</strong></p>
<p>The primary USSR event here is <strong><a href="#/card/75" title="Add a total of 3 USSR Influence to any countries in Central America (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">Liberation Theology</a></strong>.  This is like <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a> for Central America, in a way, and it is often a lifesaver because the USSR has a difficult time moving out of Cuba and into Panama or Mexico without a coup.  <strong><a href="#/card/107" title="The USSR may perform a Coup Attempt, using this card’s Operations value, against a non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa. The USSR may perform a second Coup Attempt, against a different non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa, if the first Coup Attempt removed any US Influence from the target country.">Che</a></strong> ostensibly provides some support for the region, but the USSR&#8217;s chances are really somewhat defined by their coup success and <a href="#/card/75" title="Add a total of 3 USSR Influence to any countries in Central America (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">Liberation Theology</a>.</p>
<p>The US does not really need events for Central America: their Mid War events (<a href="#/card/70" title="Add a total of 2 US Influence to any countries in Central or South America.">OAS Founded*</a>, <a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a>, and <a href="#/card/74" title="Remove 4 USSR Influence from any countries NOT in Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">The Voice of America</a>) are often better used in other regions.  The main exceptions are <strong><a href="#/card/64" title="Add 1 US Influence to Panama, Costa Rica and Venezuela.">Panama Canal Returned*</a></strong>, though even that is most useful for getting into Venezuela; <strong><a href="#/card/66" title="The US may add 1 Influence to 3 countries that do not contain Influence from either the US or USSR.">Puppet Governments*</a></strong>, which if it comes out late enough is probably best used to just grab a whole bunch of Central American non-battlegrounds; and <strong><a href="#/card/78" title="The US receives 1 VP for each US controlled Battleground country in Central and South America.">Alliance for Progress*</a></strong>, the &#8220;US <a href="#/card/61" title="The USSR receives 1 VP for Control of each of the following countries: Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Gulf States, Venezuela. This Event cannot be used after the “#86 – North Sea Oil” Event has been played.">OPEC</a>&#8221; which just gets better and better as the game goes on.</p>
<p>Likewise, the neutral events are often too valuable to be used in Central America, but <strong><a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a></strong>, <strong><a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a></strong> can all flip a country very easily.  <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a> in particular can be used for some brutal realignments by either side.</p>
<p><strong><a href="#/card/69" title="All of the phasing player’s Coup Attempts in Central and South America, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their die roll. All of the opponent’s Coup Attempts in Central and South America, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their die roll.">Latin American Death Squads</a></strong> is theoretically most helpful here, because a Domination fight often ends up turning on who controls more non-battlegrounds, as both sides coup the 1-stability non-battlegrounds back and forth.</p>
<p><strong>Late War</strong></p>
<p>The only events of note here are <strong><a href="#/card/109" title="The USSR receives 1 VP for each US Coup Attempt performed during the remainder of the Turn.">Yuri and Samantha*</a></strong>, which accomplishes much the same thing that <a href="#/card/69" title="All of the phasing player’s Coup Attempts in Central and South America, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their die roll. All of the opponent’s Coup Attempts in Central and South America, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their die roll.">Latin American Death Squads</a> did in the Mid War, and <strong><a href="#/card/91" title="Remove all US Influence from Nicaragua. The USSR may make a free Coup Attempt, using this card’s Operations value, in a country adjacent to Nicaragua.">Ortega Elected in Nicaragua*</a></strong>, which is a pretty lousy event but a DEFCON-suicide card for the US if the US has influence in Cuba.</p>
