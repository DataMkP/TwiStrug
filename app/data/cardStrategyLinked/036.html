<p>One of the Big Three Mid War neutral events, along with <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a> and <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a>.  Unlike <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a>, it works well regardless of how fortified the battleground is; unlike <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a>, it can still flip countries even at DEFCON 2 and is not geographically restricted.  Brush War&#8217;s drawback is that it depends on isolation, but isolation can be manufactured, and even with one neighbor, you still have a 50% chance of success, and those are pretty good odds for a heavily-defended battleground.</p>
<p>Brush War is most commonly used on 2-stability battlegrounds because the 1-stability African battlegrounds are easily flipped by coups or direct influence placement.  In addition, I especially like to use it on Thailand, Pakistan, or Italy: countries that are normally not subject to coups at any point, and therefore very difficult to flip once controlled.  Thailand in particular I find is a frequent Brush War target: unlike Pakistan or Italy, it is not always necessarily surrounded by similar influence.</p>
<p>Of course, Brush War can (and often does) play a key role in the Mid War regions as well.  It just happens to stand out as one of the few events that can immediately flip a European or Asian 2-stability battleground, in an otherwise very stable pair of regions.  The shifting demands of the game, of course, will dictate where Brush War ends up being used.</p>
<p>In general, the US benefits a little bit more from Brush War than the USSR: the USSR has coups, while the US often struggles to get Mil Ops and flip battlegrounds at DEFCON 2.  Plus, Italy (a lucrative Brush War target) is often off-limits to the USSR&#8217;s Brush War if <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event.
