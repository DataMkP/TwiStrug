<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Unplayable at DEFCON 2, obviously, so the USSR typically sends this to space.  Even at DEFCON 3, it&#8217;s not such a good idea to give the US 2 VPs in the Late War.  But if you must play it, either because you desperately need Ops or have another DEFCON degrader in hand, the South Korea condition is easily dealt with by first playing some influence into South Korea (and breaking US control) before triggering the event.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>An extremely strong headline, Soviets Shoot Down KAL-007 accomplishes several things at once.  It:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces DEFCON in headline, denying the USSR an AR1 coup</li>
<li>Provides the chance at an instant win by DEFCON suicide if the USSR drops DEFCON in headline</li>
<li>Gives 2 VPs</li>
<li>Allows you to conduct Operations during the headline phase</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t control South Korea, the 2 VPs and DEFCON degradation makes it a decent headline in the Late War.</p>
<p>Soviets Shoot Down KAL-007 also makes both <a href="#/card/5" title="The USSR must randomly discard a card. If the card has a US associated Event, the Event occurs immediately. If the card has a USSR associated Event or an Event applicable to both players, then the card must be discarded without triggering the Event.">Five Year Plan</a> and <a href="#/card/49" title="Exchange this card for your opponent’s highest value Operations card. If 2 or more cards are tied, opponent chooses. If the exchanged card contains an Event applicable to yourself or both players, it occurs immediately. If it contains an opponent’s Event, use the Operations value (no Event). The opponent must use this card for Operations during their next action round.">Missile Envy</a> slightly more dangerous to play in the Late War at DEFCON 2.</p>
