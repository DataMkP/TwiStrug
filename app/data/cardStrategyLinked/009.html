<p>This card starts off very strong and quickly becomes worse and worse as the game goes on.  On Turn 1, before Thailand has been claimed, this is a superb headline and an easy way to grab the crucial battleground.  By Turn 3, or worse, the Mid War, your attention is probably elsewhere, since the US will probably already have taken Thailand.  If the US hasn&#8217;t overcontrolled Thailand because you don&#8217;t have access to it, this can be a nice way to sneak into Thailand with <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a>.</p>
<p>The bonus to Operations is quite nice, though there aren&#8217;t really that many ways to spend all those Operations in Southeast Asia, since you&#8217;ll rarely venture south of Thailand.  It does mean that if you plan on playing the card during the turn, you should headline it for maximum benefit.  It&#8217;s a good headline candidate because it&#8217;s strong enough to be meaningful, but it&#8217;s not the end of the world if it runs into <a href="#/card/103" title="The US may play this card during the Headline Phase in order to cancel the USSR Headline Event (including a scoring card). The canceled card is placed into the discard pile. If this card is played by the USSR during its action round, the US gains 1 VP.">Defectors</a>.</p>
<p><em>Riku Riekkinen&#8217;s thoughts:</em></p>
<p>Vietnam Revolts is a very good headline, because it allows the USSR to instantly dominate Asia (in case the US tries to dump <a href="#/card/1" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: 9; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Asia Scoring</a> on the headline).</p>
<p>There are 4 camps regarding headlining Vietnam Revolts on Turn 1:</p>
<p>1) Don&#8217;t do that.  Wait until DEFCON is 3, so that US can&#8217;t coup you out of there.  This might cost you Thailand, depending on whether the US is already in Malaysia when you play Vietnam Revolts.  You might still be able to flip Thailand with your +1 Ops and China Card, however.</p>
<p>2) Headline it and coup Iran AR1.  Now US can start a coup-counter coup routine in Vietnam, but it&#8217;s couping at a disadvantage due to Vietnam Revolts&#8217; +1.  So the US is really looking to empty out Vietnam with a coup, which it has a 1/6 chance of doing so on each roll.</p>
<p>3) Headline it and play into Thailand &amp; Laos/Cambodia. Now, if the US coups Thailand, you can coup it back at +1.  Even if the US empties Thailand, preventing you from counter-couping, you still have backup countries in Southeast Asia and can retake Thailand before the US.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s generally agreed that couping Iran is the best move for USSR on Turn 1 AR1. However, if you&#8217;re playing with influence bids for the US, Iran is sometimes overcontrolled so heavily that couping Iran is no longer worthwhile.  This Vietnam Revolts headline play is a strong alternative, and probably much better than <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a> &amp; Italy.</p>
<p>4) Headline it and play <a href="#/card/1" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: 9; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Asia Scoring</a> on AR1, scoring a quick and dirty Domination.  Probably the worst of these options, but a possibility if you have a truly, truly terrible hand (e.g., nothing but 1 Ops after a Red Purge/Scare headline).</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Completely harmless if played on the final Action Round, so long as you make sure you already took Thailand (and possibly Laos/Cambodia).  This card is a good reason not to play into Vietnam unless you need the country immediately for <a href="#/card/1" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: 9; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Asia Scoring</a> or <a href="#/card/38" title="1 VP each for Control of Burma, Cambodia/Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. 2 VP for Control of Thailand; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Southeast Asia Scoring*</a>.</p>
