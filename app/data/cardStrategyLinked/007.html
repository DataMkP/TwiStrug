<p>An all-around excellent headline throughout the game.  If you don&#8217;t have other Headline-AR1 combinations, a Socialist Governments headline can be followed up with just about anything on AR1: you can take over a European battleground, you can score Europe on hugely advantageous terms, or you can simply to take one out of the UK or Canada so that <a href="#/card/105" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country adjacent to the U.K. if the U.K. is US-controlled but NATO is not in effect. Add 2 US Influence to a single country in Western Europe, and the US gains 2 VP, if the U.K. is US-controlled and NATO is in effect.">Special Relationship</a> and <a href="#/card/106" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country containing US Influence, at the end of each Action Round, if Canada is US-controlled and the DEFCON level moved to 2 during that Action Round. This Event is canceled by the “#42 – Quagmire” Event.">NORAD*</a>, respectively, don&#8217;t trigger.</p>
<p>On Turn 1 in particular, a Socialist Governments headline can cripple the US position. It is one of the few headlines that can make an opening Italy coup worthwhile, since if you&#8217;re going to give up western Asia, you better at least do some serious damage in Europe to make up for it.  The very threat of a Socialist Governments headline also keeps the US opening setup honest, since it essentially compels the US to overcontrol Italy.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the Socialist Governments headline is a useful distraction; if you can remove three <em>important</em> influence, then even if you don&#8217;t play into Europe on AR1, the US will usually be scrambling to fix the situation on their AR1.  Later in the turn, it&#8217;s not quite as helpful, and you&#8217;re usually better off using the 3Ops or holding it for next turn&#8217;s headline.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Typically either played for Operations (to replace the influence lost), or simply played on the Space Race (especially if under <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>).  Either way, it&#8217;s an empty Action Round, but at least it&#8217;s usually not a problem to deal with; be thankful you drew it and not the USSR.  If you are not careful, you aren&#8217;t always able to replace all your Influence (e.g., if you had 2 in Greece and 1 in Turkey, and let Socialist Governments trigger first, you may no longer have access to Turkey to replace its influence).</p>
<p>Somewhat takes away the sting of a USSR play of <a href="#/card/83" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to Argentina and remove all USSR Influence from the United Kingdom. The US receives 1 VP. This Event prevents the “#7 – Socialist Governments” card from being played as an Event.">The Iron Lady*</a>, which is technically a US event but in practice far more useful for the USSR.</p>
