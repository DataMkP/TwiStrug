<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Assuming that John Paul II has been elected Pope, then Solidarity falls into the &#8220;empty action round&#8221; category of US events; it&#8217;s worth sending to space, but you can also just repair its damage (assuming you&#8217;ve overprotected Poland).</p>
<p>The main drawback of repairing rather than spacing is that it makes you more vulnerable to <a href="#/card/29" title="Early or Mid War: Remove 1 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe. Late War: Remove 2 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe.">East European Unrest</a>: if the US only has their <a href="#/card/68" title="Remove 2 USSR Influence from Poland and add 1 US Influence to Poland. This Event allows the “#101 – Solidarity” card to be played as an Event.">John Paul II Elected Pope*</a> influence in Poland, then EEU can&#8217;t grant them control no matter how many times they play it.</p>
<p>The main advantage of playing it for Ops is that you might be able to later use <a href="#/card/16" title="Remove all US influence from 4 countries in Eastern Europe or add 5 USSR Influence to any countries in Eastern Europe (adding no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Warsaw Pact Formed*</a> to more efficiently purge eastern Europe of all US influence.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is annoying no matter what to draw Solidarity, which is even further reason to send John Paul II to space if you draw it.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A fine event, suitable for AR7 or headline, especially if you can combo it with <a href="#/card/19" title="Remove all USSR Influence from a single uncontrolled country in Europe.">Truman Doctrine*</a> or some other Europe-affecting event (<a href="#/card/94" title="The US must designate a single Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) that, for the remainder of the turn, the USSR cannot add Influence to using Operations points.">Chernobyl*</a>, <a href="#/card/29" title="Early or Mid War: Remove 1 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe. Late War: Remove 2 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe.">East European Unrest</a>, etc.).  It even works well with <a href="#/card/96" title="Add 3 US Influence to East Germany. The US may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in Europe using the Operations value of this card. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#55 – Willy Brandt” Event.">Tear Down this Wall*</a> by potentially removing a USSR modifier on East Germany realignments.  And as noted earlier, Solidarity is a great way to establish enough influence in Poland so that a subsequent <a href="#/card/29" title="Early or Mid War: Remove 1 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe. Late War: Remove 2 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe.">East European Unrest</a> can grant you control.</p>
<p>I do always try to play John Paul II for the event; even if I don&#8217;t draw Solidarity later, or don&#8217;t intend to contest Poland, it&#8217;s still nice to leave a strong US event in the deck.</p>
