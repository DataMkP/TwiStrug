<p>SALT Negotiations is not quite at the level of the &#8220;Big Three&#8221; Mid War neutral events (<a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a>, <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a>, and <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a>), but it&#8217;s pretty close.  The event has three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>It raises DEFCON by 2 levels.  This is an easy way to get out of a DEFCON suicide situation, though beware your opponent dropping DEFCON twice in one move (via <a href="#/card/4" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. The US receives VP equal to 5 minus the current DEFCON level.">Duck and Cover</a> or <a href="#/card/50" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. Unless the #32 UN Intervention card is played as an Event on the US’s next action round, the USSR receives 3 VP.">We Will Bury You*</a>).  It is also if you desperately need to coup a battleground, even if that means letting your opponent get in the first coup (and letting him coup Asia).</li>
<li>It gives coups a -1 modifier.  Occasionally useful against <a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a>, and somewhat eases the volatility of raising DEFCON.</li>
<li>It retrieves a card from the discard.  This is obviously the most important part of the event. Here, SALT tends to favor the US.  Obviously both sides are interested in grabbing cards like <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a>, <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a>, or <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>, but the US also has <a href="#/card/67" title="The US randomly selects 1 card from the USSR’s hand (if available). The US must either play the card or return it to the USSR. If the card is returned, or the USSR has no cards, the US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Grain Sales to Soviets</a>, <a href="#/card/63" title="Add 1 US Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Colonial Rear Guards</a>, <a href="#/card/76" title="If the USSR has the “#6 – The China Card” card, the USSR must give the card to the US (face up and available for play). If the US already has the “#6 – The China Card” card, add a total of 4 US Influence to any countries in Asia (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">Ussuri River Skirmish*</a>, <a href="#/card/29" title="Early or Mid War: Remove 1 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe. Late War: Remove 2 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe.">East European Unrest</a> (if in the Late War), and <a href="#/card/74" title="Remove 4 USSR Influence from any countries NOT in Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">The Voice of America</a>.  Usually the USSR has <a href="#/card/61" title="The USSR receives 1 VP for Control of each of the following countries: Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Gulf States, Venezuela. This Event cannot be used after the “#86 – North Sea Oil” Event has been played.">OPEC</a> and <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a> (occasionally <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>, if early in the Mid War).  (Note that although it is usually used on recurring events, there&#8217;s no reason why you couldn&#8217;t use SALT for a starred event that your opponent discarded.)</li>
<li>A second benefit of retrieving this card is that it lets you hold an extra card to next turn.  This can be critical if you need to hold a card and also discard a card from hand (e.g., with <a href="#/card/10" title="Unless the US immediately discards a card with an Operations value of 3 or more, remove all US Influence from West Germany.">Blockade*</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that SALT Negotiations is most effective on Turn 6, and least effective on Turn 7.  And it is often a card I hold from turn to turn, waiting for something good to show up.  I am hesitant to play this for Ops, because I don&#8217;t like the risk that my opponent will draw it in the Late War, where there are even events to choose from (e.g., <a href="#/card/29" title="Early or Mid War: Remove 1 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe. Late War: Remove 2 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe.">East European Unrest</a>).</p>
<p>SALTing for <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a> deserves its own mention.  For starters, it&#8217;s <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a>, one of the best events in the game.  In addition, it either gives you two coups in exchange for one of his, or it means you can also get in a DEFCON 4 coup.  Finally, it&#8217;s a great trick for the US to pull on AR7: play SALT for <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a>, watch DEFCON rise to 5, and then headline <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a> to engage in a rare Europe realign or coup.  This is one of the rare Twilight Struggle combos that cannot be stopped by the other player under any circumstances.</p>
