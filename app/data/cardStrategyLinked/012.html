<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>An unimportant event.  No decent US player contests Romania, and so this card is always played for Ops.  Occasionally it might be headlined, if you&#8217;re deathly afraid of <a href="#/card/103" title="The US may play this card during the Headline Phase in order to cancel the USSR Headline Event (including a scoring card). The canceled card is placed into the discard pile. If this card is played by the USSR during its action round, the US gains 1 VP.">Defectors</a> and have nothing better to dump, or if you need a European non-battleground ASAP.</p>
<p>The only thing to keep an eye out for is <a href="#/card/22" title="Add US Influence to either Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, or Czechoslovakia so that it equals the USSR Influence in that country.">Independent Reds*</a>.  You&#8217;ll almost always want to trigger <a href="#/card/22" title="Add US Influence to either Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, or Czechoslovakia so that it equals the USSR Influence in that country.">Independent Reds*</a> first rather than give the US 3 influence in a country bordering the USSR.  This is especially true if <a href="#/card/19" title="Remove all USSR Influence from a single uncontrolled country in Europe.">Truman Doctrine*</a> is not out, since the US would have the option of playing to take Romania and +1VP each time <a href="#/card/2" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: Automatic Victory; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Europe Scoring</a> comes out.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to play this as soon as I can, so that <a href="#/card/22" title="Add US Influence to either Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, or Czechoslovakia so that it equals the USSR Influence in that country.">Independent Reds*</a> can be merely situational instead of worthless.  Although the Romania Abdication/<a href="#/card/22" title="Add US Influence to either Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, or Czechoslovakia so that it equals the USSR Influence in that country.">Independent Reds*</a>/<a href="#/card/19" title="Remove all USSR Influence from a single uncontrolled country in Europe.">Truman Doctrine*</a> combo is nice, it&#8217;s not worth it to pursue it on your own.  If you play Romanian Abdication, and the USSR plays <a href="#/card/22" title="Add US Influence to either Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, or Czechoslovakia so that it equals the USSR Influence in that country.">Independent Reds*</a> later, then hey, why not Truman away the 3 influence for Romania.  But it&#8217;s otherwise not worth 3 Ops and 2 Action Rounds to score +1 VP on <a href="#/card/2" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: Automatic Victory; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Europe Scoring</a>.</p>
