<p>One of the Big Three Mid War neutral events, along with <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a> and <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a>, and one of the strongest events in the game.  Junta&#8217;s primary drawbacks are that it is region-restricted, it doesn&#8217;t provide Mil Ops, and it is less likely than the others to flip a battleground directly (since your coup odds are much lower, and you can&#8217;t coup battlegrounds with it at DEFCON 2).  But it is the only one of the three that is guaranteed to give you influence in a region.  In addition, it does two things at once, so not only does it let you realign, it will also help you set up a good realign opportunity.</p>
<p>Junta is a more common headline than <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a> / <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a>, mainly because it&#8217;s the only one of the three that can degrade DEFCON.  The choice of coup or realign gives Junta the best of both worlds: stealing the headline coup is a great option, but sometimes realignment is the safer play.  This is especially true for USSR, who can headline it, realign, and then coup on AR1 for Mil Ops and perhaps also a bigger coup.</p>
<p>After DEFCON drops to 2, Junta is almost exclusively used to set up a critical realign.  If you control Brazil and the US controls Venezuela, you can use Junta to drop 2 influence in Colombia and immediately start realigning, rather than giving the US an opportunity to coup Colombia to defend itself.  Common realigns include Costa Rica/Colombia realigning Panama, Colombia/Brazil realigning Venezuela, Venezuela/Uruguay realigning Brazil, Argentina/Peru realigning Chile, and for the US, realigning Mexico or Cuba with Guatemala or Nicaragua, respectively.</p>
<p>Because it guarantees influence placement, Junta is often a critical card to draw when neither side has made any inroads into South America.  Even if you are forced to waste the second half of the event, it may be worth it just to get into the region.</p>
<p>Some common rules questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do both influence have to go into the same country?
<ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the country you realign/coup have to be the same country as the country you placed influence in?
<ul>
<li>No.  You also don&#8217;t have to realign the same country twice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is Junta affected by <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>, <a href="#/card/25" title="All Operations cards played by the US, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their Operations value (to a maximum of 4 Operations per card).">Containment*</a>, and <a href="#/card/51" title="All Operations cards played by the USSR, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their Operations value (to a maximum of 4 Operations per card).">Brezhnev Doctrine*</a>?
<ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does a Junta battleground coup degrade DEFCON?
<ul>
<li>Yes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then what does &#8220;free coup&#8221; mean?
<ul>
<li>It means it does not give Mil Ops, and more generally, is not subject to DEFCON geographical restrictions.  (Which doesn&#8217;t matter in the case of Junta, since DEFCON 2 does not geographically prevent a coup in Central or South America, but it does matter for <a href="#/card/96" title="Add 3 US Influence to East Germany. The US may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in Europe using the Operations value of this card. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#55 – Willy Brandt” Event.">Tear Down this Wall*</a>.)</li>
