<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>You might see this as a headline (sometimes followed by an AR1 <a href="#/card/3" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 5; Control: 7; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Middle East Scoring</a>).  But unless it throws the US out of the region entirely, it is otherwise not a particularly good event, since the 2-3 influence is easily replaced.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Generally not much of a problem, since you replace the two influence lost with the two Ops of the card and give up on Lebanon temporarily.  It is only really annoying when <a href="#/card/3" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 5; Control: 7; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Middle East Scoring</a> is getting ready to be played, and the loss of Lebanon, even for a single Action Round, becomes meaningful.</p>
