<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p>A fine little event.  At this stage of the game, 2 Ops is not a big deal compared to the possibility of an instant win (by forcing your opponent to now play a card he had planned to hold to next turn).  It is especially strong if your opponent does not have <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, you might hit a card you wish your opponent had held onto, but on balance, discarding cards from your opponent&#8217;s hand is a good thing.  You could compromise and at least be careful about playing Terrorism when your opponent could have a scoring card favorable to you.</p>
<p>Terrorism works best when you combine it with other hand-reducers like <a href="#/card/5" title="The USSR must randomly discard a card. If the card has a US associated Event, the Event occurs immediately. If the card has a USSR associated Event or an Event applicable to both players, then the card must be discarded without triggering the Event.">Five Year Plan</a>, <a href="#/card/67" title="The US randomly selects 1 card from the USSR’s hand (if available). The US must either play the card or return it to the USSR. If the card is returned, or the USSR has no cards, the US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Grain Sales to Soviets</a>, or <a href="#/card/98" title="The US reveals their hand of cards, face-up, for the remainder of the turn and the USSR discards a card from the US hand.">Aldrich Ames Remix*</a>.  Losing two cards is much more painful than losing one, since you can no longer hold a card even if you have <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a>, and moreover, you might have to skip your AR7 for lack of cards.  Accordingly, as USSR, this is an outstanding event if <a href="#/card/82" title="Remove all US Influence and add 2 USSR Influence to Iran. This card’s Event requires the US to discard 2 cards, instead of 1 card, if the “#92 – Terrorism” Event is played.">Iranian Hostage Crisis*</a> has been played, one I almost always trigger.</p>
<p>I tend to play this relatively early in the turn (often on the headline), before my opponent has gone to the Space Race, thus minimizing the chance that I force my opponent to discard a card he was going to hold or Space anyway.  Terrorism can also be good as your last play if you suspect that the other side is up to something (especially against the US on Turn 10).</p>
<p>Holding <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a> and playing <a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a> are both decent counters to Terrorism by restoring your hand size.</p>
