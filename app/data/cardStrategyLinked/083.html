<p>Along with <a href="#/card/5" title="The USSR must randomly discard a card. If the card has a US associated Event, the Event occurs immediately. If the card has a USSR associated Event or an Event applicable to both players, then the card must be discarded without triggering the Event.">Five Year Plan</a> and <a href="#/card/4" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. The US receives VP equal to 5 minus the current DEFCON level.">Duck and Cover</a>, a great US event for the USSR.  The Iron Lady is more explicitly and unconditionally favorable to the USSR, and a great choice for an AR1 Argentina coup.  Even if you have no intention of attacking Argentina, it&#8217;s a good source of initiative by creating a small threat for the US while you do something else with the 3 Ops.  The VP loss is minimal, the UK influence loss is laughable, and the only real consequence is that you can&#8217;t play <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a> any more.  Which is unfortunate (since a <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a> headline + AR1 <a href="#/card/2" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: Automatic Victory; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Europe Scoring</a> remains one of the best sources of VP for the USSR), but it&#8217;s a speculative cost, and at least you have <a href="#/card/99" title="The USSR receives 1 VP. Remove 1 US Influence from any 3 countries in Western Europe.">Pershing II Deployed*</a> to substitute in its place.</p>
<p>Rules clarification: you may not trigger The Iron Lady, then play influence adjacent to Argentina if you did not previously have access to those countries.  This is because the influence placement rules restrict you to placing influence in countries adjacent to your existing influence at the beginning of the Action Round.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Better known in our gaming group as &#8220;Thatcher the Betrayer&#8221;, there is very little point to playing The Iron Lady for the event.  The usual caveats about being at +19 or -19 apply, but even in the Late War, it is very dubious indeed to trade 3 Ops and potential loss of a critical battleground for 1 VP, a speculative <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a> block, and the elimination of USSR UK influence (usually 0).</p>
<p>If the USSR already controls Argentina, then the <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a> block / 1 VP begins to look a little more attractive, but on the whole I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen the US play this for the event.</p>
