<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p>One of the Big Three Mid War neutral events, along with <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a> and <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a>, and easily one of the best events in the game.</p>
<p>Its most common use is as a free 4 Ops coup after DEFCON drops to 2.  (Somewhat ironic that an anti-ballistic missile treaty is intended to launch coups, but that&#8217;s Cold War logic for you I suppose.)  This is a pretty self-explanatory way to dramatically alter the dynamics of South America or Central America, and more rarely a way to really, <em>really</em> lock up an African battleground.  For the US, they get a small bonus here with <a href="#/card/106" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country containing US Influence, at the end of each Action Round, if Canada is US-controlled and the DEFCON level moved to 2 during that Action Round. This Event is canceled by the “#42 – Quagmire” Event.">NORAD*</a>.</p>
<p>You can also headline this to conduct operations in the headline.  Headlining it (or playing it on AR1, as USSR) gives you the chance to perform the rare Asia coup, possibly flipping Thailand or Pakistan.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to conduct operations in the headline is an all-around useful tactic.  The US can perform the SALT-ABM trick: use <a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a> to reclaim ABM Treaty to your hand at the end of the turn, pushing DEFCON up two levels.  Then as DEFCON rises to 5 next turn, you headline ABM Treaty and get to conduct operations in Europe in the headline phase: typically a series of realignments, though occasionally you might see an Italy coup.  The USSR can do this too, but it&#8217;s a little bit trickier: first, you&#8217;re giving the US a free (albeit -1) battleground coup on AR7; second, the US might headline <a href="#/card/103" title="The US may play this card during the Headline Phase in order to cancel the USSR Headline Event (including a scoring card). The canceled card is placed into the discard pile. If this card is played by the USSR during its action round, the US gains 1 VP.">Defectors</a>; third, a US 4 Ops headline would trigger before yours.  The US faces none of these problems.</p>
