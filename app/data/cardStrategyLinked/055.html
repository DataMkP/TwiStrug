<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>The only reason you&#8217;d ever want to play this for the event is for VP; adding 1 influence into a 4-stability country is like drilling for oil with a toothpick, and you&#8217;d rarely want to realign, much less coup, West Germany anyway.</p>
<p>If France somehow is still empty on Turn 4, Willy Brandt makes a decent headline by &#8220;kicking down the door&#8221; to France and giving you access.  But you should have already gotten access to France, either by forcing your way into West Germany/Italy earlier, or Decolonizing into Algeria.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>If you really, honestly, have nothing else to space, then you may as well space Willy Brandt.  Usually I&#8217;m more than happy to give the USSR a VP and play the 2 Ops, especially since I probably used <a href="#/card/23" title="Add 1 US Influence to each of any 7 non-USSR controlled countries in Western Europe. This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Marshall Plan*</a> to shore up West Germany a little.  If it hasn&#8217;t been triggered, then Willy Brandt is equivalent to a 1 Op if you use the other Op to repair West Germany.  But you don&#8217;t even really need to repair West Germany yet if <a href="#/card/2" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: Automatic Victory; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Europe Scoring</a> has come and gone.</p>
