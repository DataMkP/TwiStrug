<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>The USSR always sends Tear Down This Wall to space.  It is unplayable at DEFCON 2, but even at DEFCON 3 the event is too strong to trigger.</p>
<p>The two best ways to guard against Tear Down This Wall are <a href="#/card/16" title="Remove all US influence from 4 countries in Eastern Europe or add 5 USSR Influence to any countries in Eastern Europe (adding no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Warsaw Pact Formed*</a> and East Germany overprotection.  This event is another reason to fight for Poland against <a href="#/card/68" title="Remove 2 USSR Influence from Poland and add 1 US Influence to Poland. This Event allows the “#101 – Solidarity” card to be played as an Event.">John Paul II Elected Pope*</a> and <a href="#/card/101" title="Add 3 US Influence to Poland. This card requires prior play of the “#68 – John Paul II Elected Pope” Event in order to be played as an Event.">Solidarity*</a>, since control of Poland defends against a realignment of East Germany.  It is also why Czechoslovakia is a common dumping ground for free USSR influence from <a href="#/card/14" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of 4 non-US controlled countries of Eastern Europe.">Comecon*</a> or Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>The defining card of the US Late War Europe onslaught.  Tear Down This Wall all but guarantees the takeover of at least one European battleground and is a key factor behind most US Late War Europe Control victories.</p>
<p>You almost always want to realign, since only Italy among the battlegrounds has a low enough stability to consider couping, and even then it&#8217;s not coupable at DEFCON 2.  The most common realignment targets are France and East Germany: France you should have significant positive modifiers on, and East Germany is usually the last USSR battleground in Europe standing between you and Europe Control.</p>
<p>To maximize Tear Down This Wall&#8217;s effectiveness, try to hold it to combine with other European events like <a href="#/card/29" title="Early or Mid War: Remove 1 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe. Late War: Remove 2 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe.">East European Unrest</a> or <a href="#/card/94" title="The US must designate a single Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) that, for the remainder of the turn, the USSR cannot add Influence to using Operations points.">Chernobyl*</a>.  In addition, try to prepare your realignment with better odds—if you plan to realign East Germany, you&#8217;ll want to take over Poland and Czechoslovakia before doing so, lest you just realign away your own influence.</p>
<p>Rules clarification: the &#8220;free coup&#8221; only signifies that you are permitted to coup in Europe even if DEFCON is lower than 5.  It still degrades DEFCON if you coup a battleground.</p>
