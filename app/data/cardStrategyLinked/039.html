<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p>Note that it doesn&#8217;t matter whether your opponent has met his Military Operations requirements: all that matters is whether you have, and whether you have more than he does. Usually it will be the USSR that benefits from this event, but a US player with <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a> or something similar can often benefit as well.</p>
<p>Assuming that you will not be playing this for the 1 VP (absent extraordinary circumstances), Arms Race thus becomes a rather straightforward choice between 3 Ops or 3 VPs.  In this, Arms Race is quite unlike most of the Ops-for-VPs events in that it is actually worthwhile: 3 VPs are often superior to 3 Ops, especially late in the Mid War.  (Compare to say, <a href="#/card/60" title="The USSR receives 1 VP. If the “#32 – UN Intervention” Event is played later this turn, either by the US or the USSR, the USSR receives an additional 1 VP.">U2 Incident*</a>.)</p>
<p>But it depends on how you&#8217;d use those 3 Ops: flipping a battleground, in and of itself, is only worth 2 VPs, but denying or achieving a Domination bonus adds an additional 2-4VPs, depending on the region.  So for example, if you have no other options, Arms Race is better used for Ops if you are flipping a 1-stability African battleground and achieving Domination as a result.  But if you already have Domination, 3 VPs are better than those 3 Ops even if you flip the battleground.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want to wait as long as possible in the turn to decide whether you need Arms Race&#8217;s 3 Ops, or if you can get by without and get the VPs instead.  Of course, it is never so easy in Twilight Struggle &#8212; the longer you wait, the more likely it is that your opponent equals your Mil Ops, at which point the 3 VPs are no longer available to you.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, I tend to play Arms Race for VPs towards the end of the Mid War (even holding it between turns if necessary), and early in the Mid War I hold it until the end of the turn and look for an opportunity to trigger it for VPs.  In the Late War I will almost certainly take the 3 VPs (and actively try for it).</p>
<p>As a final note, Arms Race is often pretty high up on the list of &#8220;lousiest cards to receive through <a href="#/card/49" title="Exchange this card for your opponent’s highest value Operations card. If 2 or more cards are tied, opponent chooses. If the exchanged card contains an Event applicable to yourself or both players, it occurs immediately. If it contains an opponent’s Event, use the Operations value (no Event). The opponent must use this card for Operations during their next action round.">Missile Envy</a>&#8221;, despite the thematic appropriateness.</p>
