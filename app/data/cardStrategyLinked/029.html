<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>In the Early War and Mid War, this is generally at worst an empty Action Round and nothing more.  If under Red Purge, then it&#8217;s slightly worse than an empty Action Round, but the only two countries that really matter to you in Eastern Europe should be East Germany and Poland.</p>
<p>Much as the threat of a <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a> headline forces the US to slightly overprotect its Western European battlegrounds, so too does East European Unrest force the USSR to overprotect its battlegrounds, as otherwise an EEU headline would be quite awkward for the USSR.  And if you&#8217;ve overprotected the two battlegrounds enough (or <a href="#/card/14" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of 4 non-US controlled countries of Eastern Europe.">Comecon*</a> / Warsaw Pact did it for you), then this isn&#8217;t even an empty Action Round, and you can freely spend the Ops elsewhere.  Think of it as transferring 3 Ops from Eastern Europe to somewhere else.</p>
<p>In the Late War, this card is absolutely miserable.  Losing 4 Influence from East Germany / Poland simultaneously, right as you&#8217;re being hit with <a href="#/card/94" title="The US must designate a single Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) that, for the remainder of the turn, the USSR cannot add Influence to using Operations points.">Chernobyl*</a> / <a href="#/card/96" title="Add 3 US Influence to East Germany. The US may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in Europe using the Operations value of this card. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#55 – Willy Brandt” Event.">Tear Down this Wall*</a> / <a href="#/card/101" title="Add 3 US Influence to Poland. This card requires prior play of the “#68 – John Paul II Elected Pope” Event in order to be played as an Event.">Solidarity*</a>, can be brutal.  It&#8217;s not quite as bad as the others, but it&#8217;s a good candidate for the Space Race.  Be glad you drew it and not the US.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>In the Early War and Mid War, you usually have something better to do than remove from 3 Influence from overprotected or irrelevant countries.  It can be a decent headline (threatening <a href="#/card/2" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: Automatic Victory; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Europe Scoring</a> on AR1) or AR7 play, but usually the USSR has overprotected East Germany and Poland enough that there&#8217;s not much point to it.</p>
<p>In the Late War, this card is an absolute monster.  Combined with all the other pro-US Europe cards, being able to delete two influence from East Germany and Poland simultaneously is huge.  It&#8217;s more than just a 4Ops equivalent: its real use is to break USSR control of the two countries, allowing you to pour in influence without paying the 2-for-1 penalty.  Coupled with <a href="#/card/94" title="The US must designate a single Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) that, for the remainder of the turn, the USSR cannot add Influence to using Operations points.">Chernobyl*</a>, it opens the floodgates to the Late War American takeover of Europe.  If you draw it on Turn 7, do everything in your power to hold it until next turn.</p>
