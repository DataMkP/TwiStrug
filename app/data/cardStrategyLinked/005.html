<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>One of two excellent Early War US events for the USSR, the other being <a href="#/card/4" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. The US receives VP equal to 5 minus the current DEFCON level.">Duck and Cover</a>.  By playing it on your last Action Round, you can discard the one remaining card in your hand, which, conveniently, happens to be a scoring card for a region that you don&#8217;t want to score.  This is the only way for the USSR to get rid of a scoring card without playing it.</p>
<p>Even if you aren&#8217;t using Five Year Plan to discard scoring cards, its discard can be timed to  mitigate the effect of a low-Op US event.  For instance, <a href="#/card/70" title="Add a total of 2 US Influence to any countries in Central or South America.">OAS Founded*</a> is a hugely problematic card for the USSR because you only have 1 Op to deal with the 2 US influence it places.  But by playing Five Year Plan when you only have <a href="#/card/70" title="Add a total of 2 US Influence to any countries in Central or South America.">OAS Founded*</a> left, you are now able to respond with 3 Ops instead of just 1.  Similar tricks can be performed with most of the other annoying US 1 Op cards (e.g., <a href="#/card/72" title="Remove all USSR Influence from Egypt and add 1 US Influence to Egypt.">Sadat Expels Soviets*</a>, <a href="#/card/19" title="Remove all USSR Influence from a single uncontrolled country in Europe.">Truman Doctrine*</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Five Year Plan can be a serious liability in a hand of DEFCON suicide cards.  Either you risk playing it early on (hoping the US doesn&#8217;t draw one of the suicide cards), or you&#8217;re forced to treat it as yet another unplayable card in your hand.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Almost always played for operations.  Occasionally played for the event: one possibility is that you know that the USSR is trying to hold a DEFCON suicide card, and by cutting their handsize (perhaps in conjunction with other handsize-reducers like <a href="#/card/67" title="The US randomly selects 1 card from the USSR’s hand (if available). The US must either play the card or return it to the USSR. If the card is returned, or the USSR has no cards, the US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Grain Sales to Soviets</a>), you can force them to play it and lose.  If you&#8217;re able to hold onto <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a> and play several discarders against your opponent, you might be able to force a DEFCON victory.  Alternatively, if you&#8217;re desperate, you might play it in hopes of drawing an otherwise game-ending card like <a href="#/card/100" title="If the DEFCON level is 2, the player may immediately end the game after giving their opponent 6 VP. How about a nice game of chess?">Wargames*</a> or an unfavorable scoring card.  In the Early War, with excellent card knowledge, you may be able to force out <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a> or <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a> if you are fortunate.  The event is also more attractive while under <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>, since it slows the USSR down at the cost of only 2 Ops.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you should always play this for operations.  3 Ops is quite valuable in the Early War for the US, and moreover, playing Five Year Plan risks drawing <a href="#/card/4" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. The US receives VP equal to 5 minus the current DEFCON level.">Duck and Cover</a> and losing the game by thermonuclear war.</p>
