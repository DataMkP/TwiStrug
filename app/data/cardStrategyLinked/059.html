<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>It is hard for me to imagine when I would ever play this for the event.  Conceivably, if I used <a href="#/card/62" title="The US reveals their hand of cards. The USSR may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Lone Gunman*</a> to spy on the US hand, and saw that they had literally a ton of &#8220;War&#8221; cards, then Flower Power would be worth it.  Conceivably.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the benefit is just way too speculative to pass up 4 Ops.  As a 1 Op card, I might take the chance.  As a 4 Ops, you&#8217;d have to be crazy, desperate, or most likely, both.  Like <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event. This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a>, this is one of those events you have to hope the opponent triggers for you.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Like the USSR, you are probably not going to pass up the 4 Ops from this card.  Unlike the USSR, you&#8217;re going to have deal with its ill effects later on: chances are, you&#8217;ll probably draw at least one or two &#8220;War&#8221; cards and be forced to space them or lose 2 VP per.  Fairly annoying, and everyone has forgotten about Flower Power at one point or another and lost 2 VP without realizing it.</p>
<p>Generally I&#8217;ll just space the War cards, which isn&#8217;t a big deal until you have other cards you want to space as well (or if you&#8217;re Purged).  <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a> is of course the main exception.</p>
<p>Usually I don&#8217;t end up playing <a href="#/card/97" title="The US receives 1 VP. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#59 – Flower Power” Event.">An Evil Empire*</a> for the event unless I also have a lot of &#8220;War&#8221; cards in hand with <a href="#/card/97" title="The US receives 1 VP. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#59 – Flower Power” Event.">An Evil Empire*</a>.  And it goes without saying that if you draw Flower Power with &#8220;War&#8221; cards in hand, you should play all the Wars first.</p>
<p>Note that <a href="#/card/13" title="Pan-Arab Coalition invades Israel. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for Israel, if it is US controlled, and for every US controlled country adjacent to Israel. On a modified die roll of 4-6, the USSR receives 2 VP and replaces all US Influence in Israel with USSR Influence. The USSR adds 2 to its Military Operations Track. This Event cannot be used after the “#65 – Camp David Accords” Event has been played.">Arab-Israeli War</a>, if prevented by <a href="#/card/65" title="The US receives 1 VP and adds 1 Influence to Israel, Jordan and Egypt. This Event prevents the “#13 – Arab-Israeli War” card from being played as an Event.">Camp David Accords*</a>, does not count for Flower Power and is a safe play.</p>
