<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>About this event&#8217;s only use is the Turn 1 Comecon Trap.  As described here, a proper opening setup + headline of Comecon combo allows a AR1 realignment of both West Germany and Italy at +1.  It&#8217;s risky and prone to US counterplay in Austria, but with a little bit of luck can eliminate the US from continental Europe entirely.</p>
<p>Aside from this edge case, I always play Comecon for Ops.  The 4 influence is so scattered and usually so irrelevant that I have never seen any competent USSR player play this for the event.  It&#8217;s still nice to have around in the Late War if you come under <a href="#/card/94" title="The US must designate a single Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) that, for the remainder of the turn, the USSR cannot add Influence to using Operations points.">Chernobyl*</a> in Europe, but it&#8217;s no Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>When the US plays it, my targets for influence, in descending order, are: Poland, East Germany, Yugoslavia (assuming I opened with 4 EGER / 4 POL / 1 YUG), and Czechoslovakia (to defend against eventual <a href="#/card/96" title="Add 3 US Influence to East Germany. The US may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in Europe using the Operations value of this card. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#55 – Willy Brandt” Event.">Tear Down this Wall*</a> realignments).  But it&#8217;s mostly moot, since this influence will probably get De-Stalinized anyway.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>This is basically a free 3 Ops card.  I suppose you could hold off on playing this until after <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>, but harmless 3 Ops cards are hard to come by as US in the Early War.</p>
<p>The one interaction of note is with Eastern European Unrest.  Against a greedy USSR player who does not overprotect East Germany and Poland, you might consider headlining Eastern European Unrest and threaten a costly <a href="#/card/2" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: Automatic Victory; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Europe Scoring</a>.  This play does not work if you play Comecon first.</p>
