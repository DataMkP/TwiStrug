<p>Yet another excellent Mid War neutral event, though its capacity for DEFCON suicide keeps it a tier below <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a> / <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a> / <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a> / <a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a>.  When I draw it, I will usually headline it whenever possible.</p>
<p>There are four possible outcomes with Missile Envy:</p>
<p><strong>1. You are forced to trigger an unfavorable event.</strong></p>
<p>This is the worst case scenario with Missile Envy.  For starters, DEFCON suicide is eminently possible if DEFCON is at 2 &#8212; but even when it is at 3 in the headline, you can still lose if your opponent&#8217;s headline degrades DEFCON ahead of Missile Envy. For example, as USSR, you might pull <a href="#/card/50" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. Unless the #32 UN Intervention card is played as an Event on the US’s next action round, the USSR receives 3 VP.">We Will Bury You*</a> when the US headlined <a href="#/card/67" title="The US randomly selects 1 card from the USSR’s hand (if available). The US must either play the card or return it to the USSR. If the card is returned, or the USSR has no cards, the US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Grain Sales to Soviets</a>.  Alternatively, as US, you might pull Duck &amp; Cover or <a href="#/card/89" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1 and the US receives 2 VP. The US may place influence or make Realignment rolls, using this card, if South Korea is US controlled.">Soviets Shoot Down KAL-007*</a>7 when the USSR headlined <a href="#/card/50" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. Unless the #32 UN Intervention card is played as an Event on the US’s next action round, the USSR receives 3 VP.">We Will Bury You*</a>.  (It is also conceivable, though staggeringly unlikely, that Missile Envy pulls <a href="#/card/20" title="This player sponsors the Olympics. The opponent must either participate or boycott. If the opponent participates, each player rolls a die and the sponsor adds 2 to their roll. The player with the highest modified die roll receives 2 VP (reroll ties). If the opponent boycotts, degrade the DEFCON level by 1 and the sponsor may conduct Operations as if they played a 4 Ops card.">Olympic Games</a> or <a href="#/card/45" title="Both players roll a die. Each player receives +1 to the die roll for each Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) they Dominate or Control. The player with the highest modified die roll receives 2 VP and may degrade or improve the DEFCON level by 1 (do not reroll ties).">Summit</a>, both of which can also degrade DEFCON.)</p>
<p>Aside from DEFCON suicide, it is also possible (though extremely rare) that the event you pull with Missile Envy is harmful to you.  For instance, <a href="#/card/34" title="The player receives VP equal to the current DEFCON level minus 2 then improves the DEFCON level by 2.">Nuclear Test Ban</a> might raise DEFCON at a point when you want to lower it.  In general, as long as either <a href="#/card/50" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. Unless the #32 UN Intervention card is played as an Event on the US’s next action round, the USSR receives 3 VP.">We Will Bury You*</a> (for USSR) or <a href="#/card/4" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. The US receives VP equal to 5 minus the current DEFCON level.">Duck and Cover</a>/<a href="#/card/89" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1 and the US receives 2 VP. The US may place influence or make Realignment rolls, using this card, if South Korea is US controlled.">Soviets Shoot Down KAL-007*</a>7 (for US) are out of the game, then I don&#8217;t worry about the possibility of losing the game via Missile Envy, especially in the headline, and especially if I&#8217;m the US (since the USSR rarely lowers DEFCON in headline).</p>
<p><strong>2. You are forced to trigger a meaningless event.</strong></p>
<p>The second-worst possible outcome.  More commonly happens to the US: US/Japan Defense Pact and <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event. This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a> are the best examples.  <a href="#/card/39" title="Compare each player’s value on the Military Operations Track. If the phasing player has a higher value than their opponent on the Military Operations Track, that player receives 1 VP. If the phasing player has a higher value than their opponent, and has met the “required” amount, on the Military Operations Track, that player receives 3 VP instead.">Arms Race</a> is often a wash as well.  This rarely happens to the USSR as its high Ops events are almost always useful.</p>
<p>Even in this situation, I still consider Missile Envy a net plus, since you&#8217;ve eliminated a high Ops card from your opponent&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p><strong>3. You trigger a event good for you.</strong></p>
<p>Generally the second-best possible outcome, depending on how good the event is.  Most of the really good events have high Ops, and so the possibilities range from <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>, <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a>, <a href="#/card/56" title="Remove all US Influence from 2 of the following countries: Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan. This Event cannot be used after the “#110 – AWACS Sale to Saudis” Event has been played.">Muslim Revolution</a>, or <a href="#/card/23" title="Add 1 US Influence to each of any 7 non-USSR controlled countries in Western Europe. This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Marshall Plan*</a>, to <a href="#/card/51" title="All Operations cards played by the USSR, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their Operations value (to a maximum of 4 Operations per card).">Brezhnev Doctrine*</a>, <a href="#/card/44" title="On the USSR’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each USSR action round until the USSR successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the USSR is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn.">Bear Trap*</a>, <a href="#/card/76" title="If the USSR has the “#6 – The China Card” card, the USSR must give the card to the US (face up and available for play). If the US already has the “#6 – The China Card” card, add a total of 4 US Influence to any countries in Asia (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">Ussuri River Skirmish*</a>, or <a href="#/card/61" title="The USSR receives 1 VP for Control of each of the following countries: Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Gulf States, Venezuela. This Event cannot be used after the “#86 – North Sea Oil” Event has been played.">OPEC</a>.  Of course, maybe you trigger something that is only speculatively helpful, like <a href="#/card/59" title="The USSR receives 2 VP for every US played “War” card (Arab-Israeli War, Korean War, Brush War, Indo-Pakistani War, Iran-Iraq War), used for Operations or an Event, after this card is played. This Event is prevented / canceled by the “#97 – An Evil Empire” Event.">Flower Power*</a>, but in general, your high Ops events are good to trigger in exchange for 2 Ops.</p>
<p><strong>4. You get to conduct Operations.</strong></p>
<p>I consider this generally the best possible outcome.  Not only can you conduct operations in the headline, but you&#8217;ve also eliminated a high Ops event (a potentially powerful opponent&#8217;s event) from your opponent&#8217;s hand.  Taking <a href="#/card/56" title="Remove all US Influence from 2 of the following countries: Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan. This Event cannot be used after the “#110 – AWACS Sale to Saudis” Event has been played.">Muslim Revolution</a> and turning it into a no-strings-attached 4 Ops US coup is a gamechanger.</p>
<p>[The above analysis, incidentally, illustrates that I usually try to hand over their event or a neutral event rather than my own event.]</p>
<p>The second half of Missile Envy is usually just as strong: the fact that you force your opponent into a 2 Ops play on AR1 is very exploitable.  For example, as US, when you headline Missile Envy, the USSR is now forced to either coup with a 2 Ops or let you coup. Not a big deal if he&#8217;s couping Zaire, but a real discomfort if he was counting on a big coup to get into South America.  Conversely, the USSR can headline Missile Envy then make an AR1 play for a battleground knowing that the US response can only be 2 Ops.</p>
<p>In general I do not use Missile Envy during the middle of the turn, first because DEFCON is already 2 (furthering the risk of nuclear suicide), and second because the opponent will have already used high Ops cards, and I&#8217;m no longer assured of a 3 or 4 Ops card.</p>
<p>Missile Envy may combo well if you know your opponent&#8217;s hand already (i.e., you headlined <a href="#/card/26" title="The USSR reveals their hand of cards for this turn. The US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">CIA Created*</a> or <a href="#/card/62" title="The US reveals their hand of cards. The USSR may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Lone Gunman*</a>), since you can have an idea of what you will be getting.</p>
