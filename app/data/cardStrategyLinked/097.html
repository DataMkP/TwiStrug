<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Not much of a concern, since even in the Late War 3 Ops is probably better than 1 VP.  It&#8217;s best if played at the end of the turn, but if you can&#8217;t manage that it&#8217;s not a huge deal.  This event is only irritating in the sense that all of the US +1 VP cards tend to show up right as you&#8217;re trying to win by <a href="#/card/100" title="If the DEFCON level is 2, the player may immediately end the game after giving their opponent 6 VP.

<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Not a good event, unless you hold a lot of &#8220;war&#8221; cards and desperately need to cancel <a href="#/card/59" title="The USSR receives 2 VP for every US played “War” card (Arab-Israeli War, Korean War, Brush War, Indo-Pakistani War, Iran-Iraq War), used for Operations or an Event, after this card is played.
