<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 1<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Several things combine to make this one of the nastiest US cards in the game for the USSR to deal with:</p>
<ol>
<li>For starters, 1 Op is obviously not enough to offset the 2 influence.  It also makes it unspaceable.</li>
<li>If neither side is in South America, then it is terrible to just hand it over to the US with such an event.</li>
<li>Even if both sides are already in South America, OAS Founded has so many different targets for its influence that it is therefore nearly impossible to preemptively defend against (like the US can with <a href="#/card/54" title="Add 2 USSR Influence to Chile.">Allende*</a>).</li>
<li>In particular, all of the 2-stability battlegrounds in the Americas are vulnerable to OAS Founded.  If Brazil is 0/2, then OAS Founded will make it either 2/2 or 2/3, and then a 3 Ops card is enough to take it over.</li>
</ol>
<p>Accordingly, unless one side or the other has thoroughly locked up the Americas, I hold onto it until I can find one of the following ways of discarding it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If neither side is in South America, it&#8217;s sometimes worth a speculative gamble to headline OAS Founded, thereby giving you a juicy coup target on AR1.  This could backfire horribly, though, if the US lowers DEFCON in the headline, denying you the coup, or if the US puts influence into Chile, whereupon you probably have to realign Chile instead (and give the US the battleground coup).</li>
<li><a href="#/card/51" title="All Operations cards played by the USSR, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their Operations value (to a maximum of 4 Operations per card).">Brezhnev Doctrine*</a> allows you to space the card or repair its damage with 2 Ops instead of 1.  The latter is usually preferable, but the former can be better if the US isn&#8217;t in South America yet.</li>
<li><a href="#/card/5" title="The USSR must randomly discard a card. If the card has a US associated Event, the Event occurs immediately. If the card has a USSR associated Event or an Event applicable to both players, then the card must be discarded without triggering the Event.">Five Year Plan</a>, in addition to being able to magically discard scoring cards, can also magically discard OAS Founded if played on AR7 holding only these two cards.  It will still trigger the event, but now you have 3 Ops with which to deal with OAS Founded, rather than just 1.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>This is a gigantic pain for the USSR to deal with, and so it&#8217;s nice if you can return it to the draw deck for the USSR to draw.  I often find, however, that I can put it to better use either as a normal event (if neither side is in South America and DEFCON has dropped to 2), or as a particularly painful AR7 play.  It is also a nice headline by threatening an advantageous AR1 scoring.</p>
