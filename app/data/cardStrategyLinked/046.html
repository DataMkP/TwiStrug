<p>A straightforward way to manipulate DEFCON, so it works in all the situations you&#8217;d expect: DEFCON-suicide cards, situations where your opponent can&#8217;t coup due to <a href="#/card/42" title="On the US’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#106 – NORAD” Event (if applicable).">Quagmire*</a>/<a href="#/card/44" title="On the USSR’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each USSR action round until the USSR successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the USSR is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn.">Bear Trap*</a> or <a href="#/card/40" title="Set the DEFCON level to 2. Any Coup Attempts by your opponent, for the remainder of this turn, will result in Global Thermonuclear War. Your opponent will lose the game. This card’s Event may be canceled, at any time, if the USSR removes 2 Influence from Cuba or the US removes 2 Influence from West Germany or Turkey.">Cuban Missile Crisis*</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Like other DEFCON degraders, it&#8217;s also useful as a headline trap, since if your opponent&#8217;s headline degrades DEFCON and is subsequent to yours, you instantly win.  (One advantage HILTSW holds over headlining other DEFCON degraders is that it can&#8217;t backfire if your opponent also tries to lower DEFCON in the headline.)</p>
<p>The Mil Ops is what really sets this card apart: it means you can headline it to prevent battleground coups, but also earn your Mil Ops VPs at the end of the turn.  In addition, it gives the US a little trick on the last Action Round: use How I Learned to Stop Worrying to set DEFCON to 5, meaning instead of losing 2 VP to Mil Ops requirements, you can force the USSR to lose up to 3 VP to Mil Ops.</p>
<p>So, like most Mid War cards, this one tilts slightly to the US, who often needs both DEFCON at 2 and Mil Ops more than the USSR does.  But the USSR can get good value out of it as a DEFCON raiser: if they headline the card, they might be able to raise DEFCON to 4 or 5 and be able to coup Asia / realign Europe on AR1.</p>
