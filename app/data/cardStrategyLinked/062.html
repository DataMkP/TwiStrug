<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>I usually try to keep this in the deck, especially if I&#8217;m not doing well as the USSR.  But it does make for a decent headline, especially if you draw this on Turn 7 or later and there&#8217;s no way it would end up in the US hand anyway.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always lovely when the US is forced to headline this event, especially since you can either use the 1 Op for influence or realignments, and then coup with a bigger card on AR1, or just coup with it in the headline to avoid <a href="#/card/106" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country containing US Influence, at the end of each Action Round, if Canada is US-controlled and the DEFCON level moved to 2 during that Action Round. This Event is canceled by the “#42 – Quagmire” Event.">NORAD*</a>.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Lone Gunman is in general the most painful DEFCON degrader in the game.  You can&#8217;t space it, like with <a href="#/card/50" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. Unless the #32 UN Intervention card is played as an Event on the US’s next action round, the USSR receives 3 VP.">We Will Bury You*</a>.  You can&#8217;t match it up with <a href="#/card/25" title="All Operations cards played by the US, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their Operations value (to a maximum of 4 Operations per card).">Containment*</a>, which should usually get triggered in the Early War.  It&#8217;s worse than its counterpart <a href="#/card/26" title="The USSR reveals their hand of cards for this turn. The US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">CIA Created*</a> because you&#8217;ll always have influence to target with it, and you can&#8217;t play it on AR1.</p>
<p>So unless you headline it, you&#8217;ll almost never get a chance to get rid of this DEFCON suicide card.  The general DEFCON article discusses in greater detail how to deal with cards like these, so I will just make a few particular notes:</p>
<p>One unusual way to escape Lone Gunman, if you can&#8217;t hold a card to next turn, is to <a href="#/card/42" title="On the US’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#106 – NORAD” Event (if applicable).">Quagmire*</a> yourself on the second-to-last turn holding just Lone Gunman.  As you can&#8217;t discard Lone Gunman, you just skip your Action Round and get to hold it to next turn.  Obviously not ideal, but still preferable to DEFCON suicide.</p>
<p>I generally hold Lone Gunman turn to turn until I find some way to get rid of it.  The alternative is just to bite the bullet and headline it, but the problem, of course, is that Lone Gunman causes maximum hurt in the headline phase and can still lose you the game if the USSR headlines a DEFCON degrader.  (Usually the USSR doesn&#8217;t, though, since they intend to coup, but <a href="#/card/106" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country containing US Influence, at the end of each Action Round, if Canada is US-controlled and the DEFCON level moved to 2 during that Action Round. This Event is canceled by the “#42 – Quagmire” Event.">NORAD*</a> changes this dynamic somewhat.)</p>
<p>However, if you are forced to lose a card, via <a href="#/card/10" title="Unless the US immediately discards a card with an Operations value of 3 or more, remove all US Influence from West Germany.">Blockade*</a>, <a href="#/card/98" title="The US reveals their hand of cards, face-up, for the remainder of the turn and the USSR discards a card from the US hand.">Aldrich Ames Remix*</a>, or <a href="#/card/92" title="The player’s opponent must randomly discard 1 card from their hand. If the “#82 – Iranian Hostage Crisis” Event has already been played, a US player (if applicable) must randomly discard 2 cards from their hand.">Terrorism</a>, holding Lone Gunman basically loses you the game if you can&#8217;t raise DEFCON or play <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a>.  So if you are threatened by any of those and lack <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a>, you are basically forced to headline Lone Gunman rather than risk the loss.</p>
<p>Finally, never give up just because you realize you are stuck with Lone Gunman!  There is always the chance that the last USSR play will be Ask Not &#8230;</p>
