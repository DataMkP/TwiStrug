<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>One of the most problematic US cards in the Early War.  No event places more influence on the board than Marshall Plan.  The best way to defuse this card is by controlling the important countries beforehand: if you&#8217;re able to sew up the 2-stability countries before it is triggered, then Marshall Plan influence gets mostly sent to unimportant countries.  At the very least, you want to use the 4 Ops of this card to control Greece or Turkey before triggering the event, lest you turn all of Europe blue.</p>
<p>Another option is to send Marshall Plan to space.  This is more plausible when you&#8217;re under Red Purge and therefore cannot control two of the Mediterranean countries with the card&#8217;s Ops.  Even if you aren&#8217;t, it&#8217;s sometimes worthwhile to sacrifice the 4 Ops of Marshall Plan: you&#8217;ll have to find the Ops eventually to play into Europe, but there are definitely situations where you&#8217;re better off in Europe without the poisoned 4 Ops of Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>The best way of playing Marshall Plan is with <a href="#/card/32" title="Play this card simultaneously with a card containing an opponent’s associated Event. The opponent’s associated Event is canceled but you may use the Operations value of the opponent’s card to conduct Operations. This Event cannot be played during the Headline Phase.">UN Intervention</a>, which gets you the best of both worlds.  It is in fact probably the best Early War USSR candidate for <a href="#/card/32" title="Play this card simultaneously with a card containing an opponent’s associated Event. The opponent’s associated Event is canceled but you may use the Operations value of the opponent’s card to conduct Operations. This Event cannot be played during the Headline Phase.">UN Intervention</a>, along with <a href="#/card/26" title="The USSR reveals their hand of cards for this turn. The US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">CIA Created*</a> (if you have influence in a Mid War region).</p>
<p>Ideally, you&#8217;d like to play Marshall Plan as late as possible so that the US can waste most of its effect.  If you can bait the US into controlling Canada before Marshall Plan, for instance, before playing Marshall Plan, you&#8217;ve effectively wasted a US Operations point.  In particular, if you do space Marshall Plan (or <a href="#/card/32" title="Play this card simultaneously with a card containing an opponent’s associated Event. The opponent’s associated Event is canceled but you may use the Operations value of the opponent’s card to conduct Operations. This Event cannot be played during the Headline Phase.">UN Intervention</a> it), then it&#8217;s a pretty painless 4 Ops in the Mid War.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that if you also have <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event. This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a> in your hand, you should play <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event. This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a> first, before Marshall Plan (and before the US can trigger <a href="#/card/16" title="Remove all US influence from 4 countries in Eastern Europe or add 5 USSR Influence to any countries in Eastern Europe (adding no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Warsaw Pact Formed*</a>).</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>This is best as a Turn 1 Headline, because you can adjust your opening setup to take advantage of it.  As the game goes on, it gets worse and worse because as countries are controlled, the influence becomes less and less helpful.  But it remains very powerful even if played in an Action Round; if you can get Marshall into the 2-stability Mediterranean countries on Turn 1 or 2, you probably won&#8217;t ever be dominated in Europe (and conversely you can assure Domination if you get France).</p>
<p>This is therefore the only starred US event in the Early War that I will almost always play for the event, because it is too risky to let this get into the reshuffle.  If it comes back on Turn 3, it might still do some good, but if it comes back any later it probably won&#8217;t accomplish anything.  Of course, there will be times when you don&#8217;t need Marshall Plan for European domination and/or desperately need the 4 Ops elsewhere, and in those situations you should feel free to let it go.  But in general, Marshall Plan is the rare starred event that gets worse and worse as the game goes on.</p>
<p>On the flip side, be careful you don&#8217;t rush too quickly into Europe, as otherwise the effect of Marshall Plan will mostly be wasted.  Of course, there is always a sense of urgency in Twilight Struggle, and Marshall&#8217;s influence is even more wasted if you let the USSR take all the Mediterranean countries first.  But for example, if the UK is hit with <a href="#/card/28" title="Remove a total of 4 US Influence from France, the United Kingdom and Israel (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">Suez Crisis*</a>, there&#8217;s no need to patch it back up to 5 immediately as you may as well wait for the Marshall Plan influence.</p>
<p>The countries I target with Marshall Plan, in descending priority:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spain/Portugal, Greece, Turkey</li>
<li>Italy, West Germany</li>
<li>Canada (if I don&#8217;t already control it), UK (even if I already control it, if <a href="#/card/28" title="Remove a total of 4 US Influence from France, the United Kingdom and Israel (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">Suez Crisis*</a> hasn&#8217;t come out)</li>
<li>France (only if I already control it or if I plan to play into it this turn, but not if I&#8217;m using De Gaulle or <a href="#/card/28" title="Remove a total of 4 US Influence from France, the United Kingdom and Israel (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">Suez Crisis*</a>)</li>
<li>Benelux, Denmark</li>
</ul>
