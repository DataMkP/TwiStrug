<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>NATO is a pretty terrible event and therefore a great card to draw, given the scarcity of 4 Ops in the Early War.  It&#8217;s especially nice to play as soon as possible, before <a href="#/card/23" title="Add 1 US Influence to each of any 7 non-USSR controlled countries in Western Europe. This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Marshall Plan*</a> / Warsaw Pact are triggered, but even if you trigger the NATO event it&#8217;s still a nearly-free 4 Ops.</p>
<p>If you do draw it after Warsaw Pact / <a href="#/card/23" title="Add 1 US Influence to each of any 7 non-USSR controlled countries in Western Europe. This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Marshall Plan*</a> has been activated, then you should make sure you don&#8217;t plan to <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a> Italy or play <a href="#/card/105" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country adjacent to the U.K. if the U.K. is US-controlled but NATO is not in effect. Add 2 US Influence to a single country in Western Europe, and the US gains 2 VP, if the U.K. is US-controlled and NATO is in effect.">Special Relationship</a> before playing NATO.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>I have never played this card for the event as the US.  The coup/realignment restrictions are pointless because DEFCON restrictions already prevent nearly all coups and realignments in Europe.  <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a> immunity against Italy is sometimes nice, but most of the time you should have Spain / Greece / France anyway, which provide <em>de facto</em> <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country.

<p>NATO&#8217;s only real impact comes with <a href="#/card/105" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country adjacent to the U.K. if the U.K. is US-controlled but NATO is not in effect. Add 2 US Influence to a single country in Western Europe, and the US gains 2 VP, if the U.K. is US-controlled and NATO is in effect.">Special Relationship</a> in the Optional Cards, because it gives <a href="#/card/105" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country adjacent to the U.K. if the U.K. is US-controlled but NATO is not in effect. Add 2 US Influence to a single country in Western Europe, and the US gains 2 VP, if the U.K. is US-controlled and NATO is in effect.">Special Relationship</a> a substantial boost.  Even that, though, is still not worth giving up the 4 Ops.</p>
<p>What this really means is that you should try to play Warsaw Pact or <a href="#/card/23" title="Add 1 US Influence to each of any 7 non-USSR controlled countries in Western Europe. This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Marshall Plan*</a> as soon as you can in the turn, so that the USSR cannot simply play NATO with impunity.  They&#8217;ll still play it, of course, but at least they&#8217;ll give you the <a href="#/card/105" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country adjacent to the U.K. if the U.K. is US-controlled but NATO is not in effect. Add 2 US Influence to a single country in Western Europe, and the US gains 2 VP, if the U.K. is US-controlled and NATO is in effect.">Special Relationship</a> boost for it.</p>
