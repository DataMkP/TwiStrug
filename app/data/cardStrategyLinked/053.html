<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Practically speaking, South African Unrest serves much the same purposes as <a href="#/card/52" title="Add 2 USSR Influence to Angola and the SE African States.">Portuguese Empire Crumbles*</a>, though it&#8217;s a tiny bit better because its influence goes into more important countries and is recurring.  I will still usually play it for Ops, unless the 2 influence in a neighbor gives me the chance to flip Angola.  Practically speaking, 1 in South Africa is not a huge deal, and isn&#8217;t going to let you flip a controlled South Africa.  But if the countries are open to Ops, or if I haven&#8217;t been able to get into the region, then South African Unrest is a godsend.</p>
<p>I almost always choose 1 in South Africa and 2 in a neighbor.  For one, it&#8217;s 50% more influence, and no longer counterable with the card&#8217;s Ops.  For two, Angola and Botswana are both lucrative targets, and 2 influence in Angola can sometimes flip the country.  Only if I already control Angola/Botswana will I consider putting both influence into South Africa.</p>
<p>Despite a possible interpretation of the event&#8217;s text otherwise, you cannot use this for 1 in Angola and 1 in Botswana: it has to be 1 in South Africa plus 2 in Angola or 2 in Botswana.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Much more annoying to deal with than <a href="#/card/52" title="Add 2 USSR Influence to Angola and the SE African States.">Portuguese Empire Crumbles*</a>, since you can&#8217;t actually repair 3 influence with 2 Ops.  If the USSR chooses 2 in South Africa, then it&#8217;s no big deal, but 2 into Botswana and/or Angola is more annoying, especially if you want to use your Ops before the event but don&#8217;t know which one the USSR will play into.</p>
<p>That having been said, it&#8217;s a lot less painful than some other USSR events, so I usually just suck it up and play it.  But if I have nothing more urgent to space, then this is certainly going to space instead of being (at best) an empty Action Round.</p>
