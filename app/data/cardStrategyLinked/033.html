<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the most important Early War card in the deck.  Without De-Stalinization, it will be very difficult to contest the Americas.  As such, no matter how tempting, I almost always try to use all of the influence from De-Stalinization into a Mid War region.  Occasionally I will put one into Thailand, if I need immediate access to it, but the card is best for fighting for the Mid War regions.</p>
<p>I also rarely headline this card, because it is a very risky card to have Defectored.  Moreover, you have to play this at DEFCON 2, so that the US doesn&#8217;t just coup out your influence immediately.</p>
<p>If you have <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>, then De-Stalinization is an easy choice: all four into the four South American battlegrounds.  If you don&#8217;t have <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>, I will tend to put a couple into Africa (perhaps Angola and Algeria), and the other two into South America (one in Venezuela and one in Argentina or Chile).  I don&#8217;t usually place it into Central America, because I can coup Panama, <a href="#/card/8" title="Remove all US Influence from Cuba. USSR adds sufficient Influence in Cuba for Control.">Fidel*</a> grants me Cuba, and Mexico is too easily realigned out.  More importantly, De-Stalinization into South America gives me more access than De-Stalinization into Central America.</p>
<p>Remember that <a href="#/card/74" title="Remove 4 USSR Influence from any countries NOT in Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">The Voice of America</a> is the perfect antidote to De-Stalinization, so be sure to fortify your position by the Mid War so that VoA cannot just remove all of your influence.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Like <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>, this is a hold-until-Turn-3 card.  Whether or not the USSR triggers this can be game-deciding, so spacing it on Turn 3 earns you a massive advantage.  By Turn 7, this card is mostly useless, and can be safely played for Operations.  But I would rather give up West Germany to a <a href="#/card/10" title="Unless the US immediately discards a card with an Operations value of 3 or more, remove all US Influence from West Germany.">Blockade*</a> than play this in the Early War.</p>
<p>In many ways, De-Stalinization is like <a href="#/card/66" title="The US may add 1 Influence to 3 countries that do not contain Influence from either the US or USSR.">Puppet Governments*</a>, with the key difference being that it is guaranteed to be drawn by Turn 3, when it still matters.</p>
