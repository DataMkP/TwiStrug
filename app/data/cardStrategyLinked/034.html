<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p>This event is just awful.  Most of the time, it&#8217;s a 0VP card that you would trigger for the event only when you have DEFCON suicide cards in your hand.  The fact that it raises DEFCON by two levels (usually, to DEFCON 4) means that you will usually get a Action Round at DEFCON 3 after your opponent coups from DEFCON 4 to 3.</p>
<p>The other corner case is when DEFCON starts off very high for some reason, at which point this is a 4Ops for 3VPs trade.  Still not great, but maybe sometimes those 3VPs can be important.</p>
<p>But both of these are desperation moves.  98% of the time, this is just a powerful 4Ops card whose event text you skip over.  Even in that 2% where the event is meaningful, you probably would have rather been playing <a href="#/card/46" title="Set the DEFCON level to any level desired (1-5). The player adds 5 to its Military Operations Track.">How I Learned to Stop Worrying*</a> (in the first case) or <a href="#/card/39" title="Compare each player’s value on the Military Operations Track. If the phasing player has a higher value than their opponent on the Military Operations Track, that player receives 1 VP. If the phasing player has a higher value than their opponent, and has met the “required” amount, on the Military Operations Track, that player receives 3 VP instead.">Arms Race</a> (in the second case).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say its presence in the game is bad, or that the card needs a better event text.  It serves a niche role, but a crucial one (when it comes up).  More generally, not every event can, or should, be <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a> or <a href="#/card/67" title="The US randomly selects 1 card from the USSR’s hand (if available). The US must either play the card or return it to the USSR. If the card is returned, or the USSR has no cards, the US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Grain Sales to Soviets</a>: sometimes you just need to play Ops.  A game where every event was game-changing would probably be too swingy to enjoy.</p>
