<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>A bit of a weird event.  It&#8217;s not nearly as good as an event that requires the US to discard a card (e.g., <a href="#/card/98" title="The US reveals their hand of cards, face-up, for the remainder of the turn and the USSR discards a card from the US hand.">Aldrich Ames Remix*</a>), because the US will only discard to Latin American Debt Crisis if it doesn&#8217;t lead to DEFCON suicide.</p>
<p>LADC tends to get better as more influence is added to countries &#8212; for example, it&#8217;s clearly a lot better if Brazil is 6/4 rather than 3/1.  But it&#8217;s rare to see South American countries with that much influence from both sides.  If they are, then this event can be an easy way to put some pressure on the US if you don&#8217;t have many other options.  If they aren&#8217;t (i.e., LADC doesn&#8217;t pose a threat to the US position), then don&#8217;t bother with the event.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>You can usually find a time to play this event where it doesn&#8217;t have much effect.  (&#8220;Oh darn, Chile is now 0/10 instead of 0/5.&#8221;)  It&#8217;s still annoying even when applied to a USSR-controlled battleground, since it eliminates any possibility of temporarily breaking control, so it&#8217;s worth a trip to space, just at very low priority.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also use this to voluntarily discard a bad USSR card.  Ordinarily you don&#8217;t want to cut your hand size, but if you&#8217;ve already spaced something else this turn and don&#8217;t want to hold a card to next turn, this can be a good way to deal with <a href="#/card/56" title="Remove all US Influence from 2 of the following countries: Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan.
