<p>A somewhat speculative headline, Latin American Death Squads is most useful when engaged in a battle for Central America (as the coup targets are better than in South America).  It can also be used as a prophylactic defense for one of your battlegrounds in case your opponent gets the battleground coup.</p>
<p>The main limit to its usefulness is that you don&#8217;t really need that many non-battleground coups.  Therefore, events that allow more battleground coups by either side (<a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a>, <a href="#/card/46" title="Set the DEFCON level to any level desired (1-5). The player adds 5 to its Military Operations Track.">How I Learned to Stop Worrying*</a>, <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a>, <a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a>, etc.) all make LADS more useful, provided that South America/Central America is yet to be scored.</p>
