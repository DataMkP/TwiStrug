<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>On the Turn 1 headline, this has a 50/50 shot of eliminating the US from the Middle East entirely if your subsequent Iran coup is successful.  So it&#8217;s a 50/50 <a href="#/card/28" title="Remove a total of 4 US Influence from France, the United Kingdom and Israel (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">Suez Crisis*</a>, with the added benefit of 2VP and 1 influence in Israel if you succeed.  That makes it one of the better candidates for the USSR Turn 1 headline.</p>
<p>During Turn 1, a decent US player is going to take Jordan / Lebanon before investing in Israel.  (Egypt is also a good choice, but it will probably eventually fall to <a href="#/card/15" title="Add 2 USSR Influence to Egypt. The US removes half, rounded up, of its Influence from Egypt.">Nasser*</a>.)  So it&#8217;s nice to take those Israel-neighboring countries first, before the US can, so that you can wield the threat of Arab-Israeli War to keep the US from the only Middle East battleground not susceptible to Muslim Revolutions.</p>
<p>If the US does manage to solidify Jordan/Lebanon, this event is best played for Ops.  If you&#8217;re under Red Scare / Purge, maybe you would consider triggering the event, just for the Mil Ops, but the odds aren&#8217;t in your favor to actually win.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>This is not much of a threat if you draw it.  Israel is expensive enough that it is usually the last battleground in the Middle East to see any play anyway.  So when you play Arab-Israeli War early on, there&#8217;s usually not much influence at stake.  As long as you manage to get out of Israel before this event is played, even if you lose the War, it&#8217;s not a huge deal.  Accordingly, Arab-Israeli War is one of the few events where you&#8217;ll often see the opponent&#8217;s event triggered <em>after </em>the Operations are conducted.  Simply use the card to place 1 into Lebanon and 1 into Jordan or Egypt, and you will be fine.</p>
