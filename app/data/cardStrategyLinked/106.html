<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>This is a controversial event.  Some think it&#8217;s useless and too expensive to activate; others consider it the among the best US events in the game.</p>
<p>Certainly, however, everyone is in agreement that it&#8217;s not a great card for the USSR to draw, because it&#8217;s a bit too good for the USSR to play it for the US.  Accordingly, I like to space this card as USSR, but find that I often can&#8217;t spare the Ops.  In particular, on Turns 1 and 2, I&#8217;ll usually just play it for Ops because the event is not particularly useful until the Mid War.  But if I am able to, I will send this to space rather than deal with the consequences for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>NORAD has an unusual counter in <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a>, which is an all-around good USSR headline, but especially useful to defuse NORAD for an Action Round.</p>
<p>When NORAD goes into play, it becomes more important to overprotect your controlled battlegrounds, especially your 2-stability battlegrounds, if the US has influence in them.</p>
<p>NORAD is most annoying when you drop DEFCON to 2, because the US gets an influence and then gets to play immediately afterwards.  If the US drops DEFCON to 2, then it&#8217;s not as much of a problem to deal with.  This suggests that in AR7 play situations, NORAD&#8217;s presence sometimes means that you should be willing to give up the battleground coup.</p>
<p>Finally, I usually save <a href="#/card/42" title="On the US’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#106 – NORAD” Event (if applicable).">Quagmire*</a> and hope to draw <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a> with it as the USSR, but with NORAD active I will trigger <a href="#/card/42" title="On the US’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#106 – NORAD” Event (if applicable).">Quagmire*</a> ASAP.  Conversely, if NORAD is not out, I&#8217;ll hold <a href="#/card/42" title="On the US’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#106 – NORAD” Event (if applicable).">Quagmire*</a> until NORAD comes out (or until I draw <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>).</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>NORAD makes it important to control Canada.  The best way to do so is to let the USSR do it for you: <a href="#/card/23" title="Add 1 US Influence to each of any 7 non-USSR controlled countries in Western Europe. This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Marshall Plan*</a> and <a href="#/card/105" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country adjacent to the U.K. if the U.K. is US-controlled but NATO is not in effect. Add 2 US Influence to a single country in Western Europe, and the US gains 2 VP, if the U.K. is US-controlled and NATO is in effect.">Special Relationship</a> can often provide the boost you need in Canada without having to invest any of your own influence.</p>
<p>The real problem with triggering NORAD is giving up its 3 Ops.  On Turns 1 and 2 in particular, I tend to play NORAD for the Ops and hope it comes back to me early enough in the Mid War.  By Turn 3, I will generally try to spare the Ops rather than punt it until Turn 7 at the earliest.</p>
<p>The best way to make use of this is to have influence in USSR-controlled battlegrounds.  2-stability battlegrounds in otherwise DEFCON-restricted areas are great targets; the African battlegrounds are as well, but those are generally less stable and swing back and forth much more than say, Libya.  In addition, the USSR&#8217;s Asian battlegrounds, even the 3-stability ones, are excellent places for NORAD because the 5 Ops of <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a> allow you to flip more stable countries.</p>
<p>NORAD somewhat clashes with the typical US goal of lowering DEFCON to 2 in the headline phase.  In other words, by preventing the AR1 coup, you miss out on NORAD&#8217;s compensation for that coup.  It does, however, work nicely with <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a> and <a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a>, both of which can cause DEFCON to go to 2 multiple times in a turn.</p>
<p>An active NORAD makes <a href="#/card/42" title="On the US’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#106 – NORAD” Event (if applicable).">Quagmire*</a> even more unplayable, not that you wanted to play it on yourself before anyway.</p>
