<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>There is no card higher on the send-to-space priority list than Grain Sales.  Even if it weren&#8217;t a DEFCON suicide card, the fact that it cuts your handsize makes it almost always unplayable.</p>
<p>Being hit by <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a> while you have this in hand is crippling.  This card (and others like Voice of America) is a reason why the USSR tries to hang onto <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a> during the Mid War, so that they can hold multiple cards from turn to turn.</p>
<p><a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a> is a good way to try to defuse Grain Sales &#8212; either you raise DEFCON and therefore can play it without triggering suicide, or you get to draw an extra card from the deck and can hold an extra card to next turn.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>This the best US event in the game.  It is certainly by far the best all-around headline for the US: it conducts Operations, it cuts the USSR handsize, it can lead to a DEFCON win, it&#8217;s recurring, it&#8217;s unplayable by the USSR, and it&#8217;s impossible to backfire on you.</p>
<p>I almost always try to headline this, even if I have <a href="#/card/106" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country containing US Influence, at the end of each Action Round, if Canada is US-controlled and the DEFCON level moved to 2 during that Action Round. This Event is canceled by the “#42 – Quagmire” Event.">NORAD*</a> in play &#8212; the only possible exception is if I&#8217;m headlining <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a> and have <a href="#/card/44" title="On the USSR’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each USSR action round until the USSR successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the USSR is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn.">Bear Trap*</a> in hand.  In that case I will save Grain Sales for the next turn headline (but ideally trigger it before Turn 7).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the handsize reduction for the Soviets is just as painful as the Operations you get to conduct; accordingly, I almost always take the card and play it rather than return it.  (Also remember that because you&#8217;re just playing it like you&#8217;re playing any other card, you can do things like send it to space.)  Even taking a neutral 1 Ops is often superior to returning the card because of the handsize problems.</p>
<p>There are a very few instances, however, where I would return the card:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scoring cards, assuming that the USSR is unlikely to improve its position, are a good candidate to return so that you can actually conduct Operations.</li>
<li>Extremely strong USSR events like <a href="#/card/51" title="All Operations cards played by the USSR, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their Operations value (to a maximum of 4 Operations per card).">Brezhnev Doctrine*</a> or <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>, <em>IF </em>you can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to space it.  For example, if I draw <a href="#/card/50" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. Unless the #32 UN Intervention card is played as an Event on the US’s next action round, the USSR receives 3 VP.">We Will Bury You*</a>, I typically just keep it and send it to space, but if I already have a card in my hand I need to space, or if I really need to conduct Operations, then I will return it to the USSR.</li>
<li>Harsh US events, like <a href="#/card/70" title="Add a total of 2 US Influence to any countries in Central or South America.">OAS Founded*</a>, are sometimes better left as crises for the USSR player (assuming he can&#8217;t space it).</li>
<li>1 Op events, if you desperately need 2 Ops for some particular reason.  (This is rare.)</li>
</ul>
