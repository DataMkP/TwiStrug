<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Our Man in Tehran hovers just at the border of send-to-space and suck-it-up.  If I can spare the Ops, I like to send it to space, but I rarely can, and so I often just end up playing it and hoping the US doesn&#8217;t find anything good.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve already seen the important cards (good scoring cards or good USSR events like <a href="#/card/62" title="The US reveals their hand of cards. The USSR may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Lone Gunman*</a>, <a href="#/card/50" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. Unless the #32 UN Intervention card is played as an Event on the US’s next action round, the USSR receives 3 VP.">We Will Bury You*</a>, <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>, <a href="#/card/56" title="Remove all US Influence from 2 of the following countries: Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan. This Event cannot be used after the “#110 – AWACS Sale to Saudis” Event has been played.">Muslim Revolution</a>, <a href="#/card/61" title="The USSR receives 1 VP for Control of each of the following countries: Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Gulf States, Venezuela. This Event cannot be used after the “#86 – North Sea Oil” Event has been played.">OPEC</a>, etc.) go to the discard, then it&#8217;s not a big deal.  It&#8217;s also not a big deal in the rare situation where the US controls no Middle East country, or only controls a single one (and you can use the Ops to break control of the country).  And although it is slightly less effective on Turn 6 then at other times, that alone is not enough reason to feel safe about playing it.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A very nice event and one I almost always trigger.  It is worst on Turn 6, but even then it is better than its 2 Ops, especially if you have not yet seen an important card you wish to discard.</p>
