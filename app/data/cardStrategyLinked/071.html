<p>An annoying China Card event with a choose-your-poison dilemma.  The best solution to this dilemma is to ignore it altogether by sending Nixon to space; if forced to play it, I would usually rather fork over 2 VPs than <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a>, but of course this may depend on the state of the scoring track.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A good event.  2 Ops for 2 VPs is a strong trade, particularly towards the end of the Mid War, and <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a> itself is worth at least 2 VPs (because possession at the end of the game gives +1 VP for you rather than your opponent).  The main drawback is that you only get <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a> facedown, thus depriving you of an Action Round of Ops, but if you have an AR to spare, it is worth playing.</p>
