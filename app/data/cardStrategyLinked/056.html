<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Muslim Revolution is one of the main reasons US players tend to avoid the Middle East.  This is therefore one of those cards that derives much of its power from the threat rather than its actual effect.  And since it is a 4 Ops card, I am often tempted to use it for Ops instead of the event, particularly if <a href="#/card/3" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 5; Control: 7; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Middle East Scoring</a> has come and gone.</p>
<p>In general, there are three reasons I will play this for the event:</p>
<p>First, when the US controls the 3-stability battlegrounds (Iraq and Saudi Arabia).  They lose more influence, and also can&#8217;t recontrol both in a single turn.</p>
<p>Second, you have enough influence in the country to automatically take it over.  For example, if Iran is already at 4/2, then it goes to 0/2 and becomes yours after Muslim Revolution, instead of going from 2/0 to 0/0.</p>
<p>Third, if the US has no access to the affected battlegrounds and therefore can&#8217;t get back in before you.  If the US has no influence in Tunisia, Sudan, and Israel, then they can&#8217;t do anything about losing Libya/Egypt, and you have a lot of time to control them.  This is especially pertinent if it is knocking the US out of the region entirely &#8212; but be mindful of <a href="#/card/72" title="Remove all USSR Influence from Egypt and add 1 US Influence to Egypt.">Sadat Expels Soviets*</a> / <a href="#/card/65" title="The US receives 1 VP and adds 1 Influence to Israel, Jordan and Egypt. This Event prevents the “#13 – Arab-Israeli War” card from being played as an Event.">Camp David Accords*</a>!</p>
<p>Of course, make sure that what you&#8217;re doing actually affects the scoring of the region.  If the region is tied 3-3, or you are being dominated 4-2, then you&#8217;re OK with knocking the US out of two battlegrounds, letting them take one back, and then taking the other.  But if you are losing the Middle East 5-1, you need to be able to take both battlegrounds before the US does to make it worthwhile.  And if you are dominating the Middle East, then re-evaluate whether you really need the benefit from Muslim Revolution. (Of course, <a href="#/card/73" title="If this card’s Event is in effect, subtract (-1) a Battleground country from the USSR total and then discard this card during the next scoring of the Middle East or Asia (which ever comes first).">Shuttle Diplomacy</a> throws a wrench into all of this math.)</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A notorious bugbear for American players, and a commonly-spaced event.  But the threat that Muslim Revolution poses is often overrated: provided the three conditions listed above do not apply, it is usually a null event like <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a>.  If you are 2/0 on Libya/Egypt, then you lose 4 influence and have 4 Ops to put them back in.  Influence in Israel and Tunisia is a great way to do this.</p>
<p>Note that Muslim Revolution—crucially—does <em>not</em> affect Israel or Lebanon, two great places for the US to hide during the Muslim Revolution.  This is partially why Lebanon is such an important country to take in the Early War, since it is the only Middle East country completely immune to bad events until the Late War.</p>
