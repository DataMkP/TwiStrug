<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 1<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p>Summit is one of the weakest cards in the game to draw.  For starters, it&#8217;s a 1 Op card: <a href="#/card/34" title="The player receives VP equal to the current DEFCON level minus 2 then improves the DEFCON level by 2.">Nuclear Test Ban</a> might be the worst event relative to its Ops, but no one is ever unhappy to draw it.</p>
<p>Worse, like <a href="#/card/20" title="This player sponsors the Olympics. The opponent must either participate or boycott. If the opponent participates, each player rolls a die and the sponsor adds 2 to their roll. The player with the highest modified die roll receives 2 VP (reroll ties). If the opponent boycotts, degrade the DEFCON level by 1 and the sponsor may conduct Operations as if they played a 4 Ops card.">Olympic Games</a>, it has the strong possibility of losing you the game at DEFCON 2.  Although it is not a guaranteed DEFCON suicide card, you would be foolhardy indeed to play this at DEFCON 2 unless you had a massive lead in regions.</p>
<p>More commonly, because of its very low Ops value, you might headline it if there&#8217;s nothing else worth headlining and you&#8217;d rather conserve your Ops.  Alternatively, if you are absolutely desperate for VPs, Summit offers you the grim choice of a chance at 2VPs or nuclear annihilation.</p>
