<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>An event on the border between spacing and not spacing: none of the effects by themselves are particularly harmful, but the combination of all three is a little bit irritating.  The influence is often not worth repairing: <a href="#/card/72" title="Remove all USSR Influence from Egypt and add 1 US Influence to Egypt.">Sadat Expels Soviets*</a> will likely undo all the work you&#8217;ve done in Egypt.  But Camp David Accords gives the US halfway to control, and Sadat takes them the rest of the way.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A nice event, and one I try to trigger.  It is especially nice when you have no influence in Egypt, since then <a href="#/card/72" title="Remove all USSR Influence from Egypt and add 1 US Influence to Egypt.">Sadat Expels Soviets*</a> will give you Egypt instead of just putting it to 1/0.  Cancelling <a href="#/card/13" title="Pan-Arab Coalition invades Israel. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for Israel, if it is US controlled, and for every US controlled country adjacent to Israel. On a modified die roll of 4-6, the USSR receives 2 VP and replaces all US Influence in Israel with USSR Influence. The USSR adds 2 to its Military Operations Track. This Event cannot be used after the “#65 – Camp David Accords” Event has been played.">Arab-Israeli War</a> is a small bonus, and 1 VP is 1 VP.</p>
