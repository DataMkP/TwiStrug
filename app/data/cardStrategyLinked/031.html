<p>Red Scare/Purge is probably the all-around best event in the game.  Of course, there are situations where you will prefer to have other events in your hand, but <em>ex ante</em>, there is no better all-purpose event in the game for both sides.  Even if the event isn&#8217;t to your liking, it&#8217;s still a 4 Ops card in the Early War.</p>
<p>The event&#8217;s power varies from annoying to game-deciding.  If you already have a hand of 1 Ops, scoring cards, or cards you plan to play for the event, then Red Scare/Purge has little effect.  In the Early War, for example, so long as you have 3 of those cards (1 Ops, scoring, or cards to be played for the event), then you are losing 4 or less Ops overall.  Of course, 2 Ops in one play is better than 1 Op in two plays, and having your 2 Ops be cut down to 1 is especially painful when jostling for control of 2-stability country.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Red Scare/Purge can simply lose you the game.  It is a major hand management crisis when it knocks formerly dangerous-but-spaceable cards (like <a href="#/card/67" title="The US randomly selects 1 card from the USSR’s hand (if available). The US must either play the card or return it to the USSR. If the card is returned, or the USSR has no cards, the US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Grain Sales to Soviets</a> and <a href="#/card/74" title="Remove 4 USSR Influence from any countries NOT in Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">The Voice of America</a>) down to an unspaceable 1 Op: now you must either play the card, or hold it to next turn.  If you have multiple DEFCON suicide cards, Red Scare/Purge will often make some of them unspaceable, thereby causing you to either lose by DEFCON or by forcing you to trigger really unpleasant events.</p>
<p>In addition, Red Scare/Purge strengthens certain events that are otherwise mitigatable by their Ops.  <a href="#/card/17" title="Remove 2 US Influence from France and add 1 USSR Influence to France. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#21 – NATO” Event for France only.">De Gaulle Leads France*</a> is a good example: if the US already controls France, then they can play this and then restore the 3 influence of damage with the 3 Ops.  Alternatively, if no one controls France, then the US can trigger the event and take it to 3/1, so that the USSR can&#8217;t take France with a 4 Ops.  Neither of these plays are available to the US any more if they are holding a De Gaulle that has been knocked down to 2 Ops: they are now forced to give up France (good for the USSR) or send the event to space (which allows it to come back again later for the USSR to do more damage with).</p>
<p>Finally, Red Scare/Purge is a nasty combo with <a href="#/card/10" title="Unless the US immediately discards a card with an Operations value of 3 or more, remove all US Influence from West Germany.">Blockade*</a> and <a href="#/card/42" title="On the US’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each US action round until the US successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the US is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#106 – NORAD” Event (if applicable).">Quagmire*</a>/<a href="#/card/44" title="On the USSR’s next action round, it must discard an Operations card with a value of 2 or more and roll 1-4 on a die to cancel this Event. Repeat this Event for each USSR action round until the USSR successfully rolls 1-4 on a die. If the USSR is unable to discard an Operations card, it must play all of its scoring cards and then skip each action round for the rest of the turn.">Bear Trap*</a>.  With the former, you can almost guarantee a West Germany loss; with the latter, you can sometimes force your opponent to skip multiple Action Rounds in a row.</p>
<p>After triggering the event, it is important to go on the offensive and play aggressively.  The number one way to waste Red Scare/Purge is to play defensively or timidly; if you aren&#8217;t creating threats for your opponent that he is unable to deal with because of his lack of Ops, then there&#8217;s no point to headlining it and you may as well have just played it for Ops.  Force your opponent to respond to your threats: even though he usually might be able to, he will probably eventually have to give up if he is under Scare or Purge.  On the flip side, if you aren&#8217;t in such a position to play aggressively, then you should seriously reconsider headlining this event.  Either hold it to next turn or use the 4 Ops to bolster your position.</p>
<p>In summary, I will almost always play Red Scare/Purge for the event.  In the Early War, when its Ops are most valuable, I will hesitate to do so if I otherwise have very few Ops, but in the Mid War and beyond, I will usually trigger the event (and use <a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a> to play it again, if possible).  It&#8217;s a very powerful event, and playing it twice in the Early War can often decide the game.  But it&#8217;s easy to auto-play the event without carefully considering how to maximize its potential.</p>
