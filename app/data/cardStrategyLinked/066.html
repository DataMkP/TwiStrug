<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Early in the Mid War, this is usually a must-space because it gives the US access to otherwise inaccessible battlegrounds (like a poor man&#8217;s <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>).</p>
<p>But even later in the Mid War, this is still a harsh event to deal with.  The US can use it to take a bunch of non-battlegrounds, thus limiting any possibility of you scoring Domination.  Worse, it&#8217;s never clear whether you should use the Ops before or after the event: if you use it after, then the US has more targets for the influence.  But if you use it before, you&#8217;re allowing them &#8220;consecutive actions&#8221; by letting the US drop 3 influence into countries like Colombia, Saharan States, or Nicaragua for realigns on their next action.</p>
<p>So I usually try to space it.  It&#8217;s fairly low on the priority list behind <a href="#/card/67" title="The US randomly selects 1 card from the USSR’s hand (if available). The US must either play the card or return it to the USSR. If the card is returned, or the USSR has no cards, the US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Grain Sales to Soviets</a> and <a href="#/card/74" title="Remove 4 USSR Influence from any countries NOT in Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">The Voice of America</a>, of course, but I would rather the US play this event than I.  If I&#8217;m unable to space it, I try to make absolutely sure that there&#8217;s no semi-useful country out there for Puppet Governments (Afghanistan, Colombia) before playing it to coup back the most useful country that the US takes.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>, except it gets pretty lame pretty quickly.  In fact, I find its efficacy is often directly correlated with whether <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>/<a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a> have been played.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m playing this for the event, it&#8217;s either because I can place the influence in otherwise-inaccessible battlegrounds (not Mexico), I have a plan that involves controlling multiple non-battlegrounds (i.e. a headline threatening AR1 realignment, or denying an Africa Domination), or sometimes both.</p>
<p>If the USSR triggers it and all the obvious spots are taken, some frequently-overlooked countries to drop influence into include Czechoslovakia, Peru, and Tunisia, all of which offer some less-common realignment possibilities.</p>
