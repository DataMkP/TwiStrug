<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>OPEC is a bit like an extra <a href="#/card/3" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 5; Control: 7; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Middle East Scoring</a> card, except only for you.  It is up to you how many countries you need in order to trigger OPEC: I have done it for 1 VP, but usually I probably wouldn&#8217;t usually trigger it once it is 2 or fewer VPs.  Normally this ends up being around 4-5 VPs; I often hold onto it to see if I can extract some extra value out of it.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>OPEC really is like an extra <a href="#/card/3" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 5; Control: 7; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Middle East Scoring</a> card, but unlike a <a href="#/card/3" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 5; Control: 7; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Middle East Scoring</a> card, it has 3 Ops and therefore can be spaced.  And indeed, I usually do space it, since it is a rare game indeed where this isn&#8217;t scoring 3+ VPs.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also use the 3 Ops to try to break control of a USSR country to lower OPEC&#8217;s effect.  This is like a <a href="#/card/105" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country adjacent to the U.K. if the U.K. is US-controlled but NATO is not in effect. Add 2 US Influence to a single country in Western Europe, and the US gains 2 VP, if the U.K. is US-controlled and NATO is in effect.">Special Relationship</a> null play, but carries the disadvantage that you&#8217;re probably still giving up some VPs.</p>
<p>On Turn 6, this is one of those cards that I make sure to try to hold past the Turn 7 reshuffle before discarding, since this is particularly bad time to be handing the USSR an extra 4-5 VPs.</p>
<p>Incidentally, any time you see the USSR play into Gulf States, you should be on alert that OPEC is coming.</p>
