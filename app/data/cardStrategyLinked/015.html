<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 1<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>The rare Early War starred event that is actually quite worth playing by the USSR.  Nasser delivers to you a critical battleground and access to Libya, which ordinarily takes too long to get to.  The best use of this event is before the US has had a chance to put 2 into Egypt, because then it will cut the US off from Libya and essentially gain you two battlegrounds.</p>
<p>If Nasser isn&#8217;t important &#8212; either because you got into Egypt via a coup or the US has locked up both Egypt and Libya &#8212; then the normal rules about preserving your starred events apply.  No need to use this if you could potentially give the US a headache and counter the effects of <a href="#/card/72" title="Remove all USSR Influence from Egypt and add 1 US Influence to Egypt.">Sadat Expels Soviets*</a>.  This isn&#8217;t to say that you shouldn&#8217;t fight for Eygpt: the Middle East will be scored quite a bit, and you don&#8217;t want to miss out on Egypt/Libya battlegrounds if you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Nasser means you lose Egypt for the Early War.  But there&#8217;s no reason to lose Libya as well.  Accept the loss of Egypt and bide your time waiting for <a href="#/card/72" title="Remove all USSR Influence from Egypt and add 1 US Influence to Egypt.">Sadat Expels Soviets*</a>.  In the meantime, make sure you can get to Libya and secure it. Put 2 into Egypt, so that even if the USSR plays Nasser you&#8217;re not completely out of Egypt and have at least one AR where Egypt is 1/2 rather than 0/2.  This allows you to either control Libya or retake Egypt.</p>
<p>If you drew Nasser, his best use is probably on the final AR, after having locked up Libya: you use Nasser and put Egypt to 1/2.  Now the USSR has three options: 1) coup Egypt, 2) coup elsewhere, 3) control Egypt.  No matter what, you end up getting an advantage somewhere: you save a more important country from being couped, you get to retake Egypt, or you get to coup.  It&#8217;s a variant on the typical break-USSR-control-on-final-AR play.</p>
