<strong>Battlegrounds</strong>: 5<br />
<strong>Countries</strong>: 21</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>General Considerations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Although it is the highest-value region on the board, Europe is rarely one of the highest-scoring regions.  It is unusual for either side to earn anything other than 1VP or 5VP from Europe Scoring; high stabilities and DEFCON restrictions means that it is one of the most difficult regions to break through.  Only in the Late War does the situation change, thanks to a slew of powerful US events that dramatically reshape the European battlegrounds.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Despite the immense reward of Europe control, it is in practice rarely seen.  The Ops investment needed is huge, and a player that singlemindedly focuses on Europe usually ends up sacrificing the rest of the world, potentially even losing to autovictory before Europe scoring is played.  So if your opponent starts to make a push for Europe, and you can&#8217;t defend your position (because you&#8217;re under <a href="#/card/94" title="The US must designate a single Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) that, for the remainder of the turn, the USSR cannot add Influence to using Operations points.">Chernobyl*</a> or <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>), give some serious thought to giving up Europe Control in exchange for the rest of the world, and aim to win the game before Europe gets scored.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Early War</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Each side typically starts with &#8220;their&#8221; battlegrounds: East Germany and Poland for the USSR; West Germany and Italy for the US.  The USSR is sometimes able to alter this situation early on: for instance, a successful Turn 1 <a href="#/card/14" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of 4 non-US controlled countries of Eastern Europe.">Comecon*</a> Trap /  Italy coup, a successful <a href="#/card/10" title="Unless the US immediately discards a card with an Operations value of 3 or more, remove all US Influence from West Germany.">Blockade*</a>, or a well-timed <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a> can all allow the USSR to score a relatively easy Domination from just East Germany and Poland.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">These considerations aside, Europe Domination tends to depend on two things: who controls France, and who controls the 2-stability Mediterranean countries.  US players are generally hesitant to play into France before <a href="#/card/28" title="Remove a total of 4 US Influence from France, the United Kingdom and Israel (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">Suez Crisis*</a> and <a href="#/card/17" title="Remove 2 US Influence from France and add 1 USSR Influence to France. This Event cancels the effect(s) of the “#21 – NATO” Event for France only.">De Gaulle Leads France*</a> are played, since they can cripple the US position.  At the same time, without De Gaulle, the USSR is unable to play into France without either spending 2 Ops for 1 influence in West Germany or Italy first, or playing <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a> into Algeria.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The 2-stability Mediterranean countries are critical, because the odd number of battlegrounds means that one side <em>will</em> be able to score Domination unless the other side has more countries overall.  All of the other non-battlegrounds in Europe are significantly more expensive, though the US is slightly better positioned in this fight (with the aid of Canada, the UK, and <a href="#/card/22" title="Add US Influence to either Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, or Czechoslovakia so that it equals the USSR Influence in that country.">Independent Reds*</a>).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Mid War</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">At this point, Europe tends to be the most static region on the board.  If <a href="#/card/19" title="Remove all USSR Influence from a single uncontrolled country in Europe.">Truman Doctrine*</a> has already been triggered, the USSR is sometimes willing to engage in an Ops war for France.  Italy can sometimes be the target of <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a>, but with some preparatory investment in its neighbors, your opponent will generally look elsewhere with his <a href="#/card/36" title="The player attacks any country with a stability number of 1 or 2. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every adjacent enemy controlled country. On a modified die roll of 3-6, the player receives 1 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 3 to its Military Operations Track.">Brush War</a>.  <a href="#/card/68" title="Remove 2 USSR Influence from Poland and add 1 US Influence to Poland. This Event allows the “#101 – Solidarity” card to be played as an Event.">John Paul II Elected Pope*</a> will play a crucial role for the US, but he is primarily a springboard for the US in the Late War, rather than an agent of immediate change.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Late War</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Unless the USSR has already established a dominant position in Europe, it will have a very difficult time in Europe in the Late War.  Although <a href="#/card/87" title="Add 4 USSR Influence to Europe (adding no more than 2 Influence per country). If the USSR is ahead of the US in VP, 6 Influence may be added to Europe instead. The USSR may no longer make Coup Attempts in Europe.">The Reformer*</a> can provide some help, it pales in comparison to <a href="#/card/96" title="Add 3 US Influence to East Germany. The US may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in Europe using the Operations value of this card. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#55 – Willy Brandt” Event.">Tear Down this Wall*</a>, <a href="#/card/94" title="The US must designate a single Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) that, for the remainder of the turn, the USSR cannot add Influence to using Operations points.">Chernobyl*</a>, <a href="#/card/101" title="Add 3 US Influence to Poland. This card requires prior play of the “#68 – John Paul II Elected Pope” Event in order to be played as an Event.">Solidarity*</a>, and <a href="#/card/29" title="Early or Mid War: Remove 1 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe. Late War: Remove 2 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe.">East European Unrest</a>.  With <a href="#/card/94" title="The US must designate a single Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) that, for the remainder of the turn, the USSR cannot add Influence to using Operations points.">Chernobyl*</a>, the US will often sacrifice the rest of the board in pursuit of Europe control, but it must be careful of autovictory and/or <a href="#/card/100" title="If the DEFCON level is 2, the player may immediately end the game after giving their opponent 6 VP. How about a nice game of chess?">Wargames*</a>!  The one beacon of light for the USSR is <a href="#/card/16" title="Remove all US influence from 4 countries in Eastern Europe or add 5 USSR Influence to any countries in Eastern Europe (adding no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Warsaw Pact Formed*</a>, as it can singlehandedly wipe out all of the US work in Eastern Europe.  It is therefore critical for the US to trigger Warsaw Pact as early as possible, removing it from the game, so that it cannot come back as a much stronger card in the Late War.</p>
