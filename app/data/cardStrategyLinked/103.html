<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>As USSR, I only consider the threat of Defectors to be a deterrent when I am risking the loss of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a must-play event with a long-term effect (e.g., <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>, <a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a>)</li>
<li>a lot of VP (e.g., scoring cards)</li>
<li>a high Ops card on a turn where Ops are scarce (e.g., <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a> on Turns 1-2)</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, I usually don&#8217;t particularly care about Defectors.  Headlines like <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a>, or a Turn 1 <a href="#/card/28" title="Remove a total of 4 US Influence from France, the United Kingdom and Israel (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">Suez Crisis*</a> are great, but not the end of the world if they get cancelled.</p>
<p>As USSR, if I draw Defectors on Turn 1 or 2, I will try to hold it until Turn 3 before playing it for Ops.  This keeps it out of the Turn 3 reshuffle and ensures worry-free headlines for most of the game.  This is analogous to the US holding <a href="#/card/30" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of any 4 countries in Africa and/or Southeast Asia.">Decolonization</a>/<a href="#/card/33" title="The USSR may reallocate up to a total of 4 Influence from one or more countries to any non-US controlled countries (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">De-Stalinization*</a> until Turn 3, though Defectors is not nearly as important as they are.</p>
<p>A common USSR trick against Defectors is to headline a scoring card for a region that you are being Dominated in.  This is most effective when against a relatively inexperienced US player, and when you haven&#8217;t seen Defectors come out Turns 1 or 2 (meaning it is guaranteed to be in his hand on Turn 3). It is one of the rare ways to discard a scoring card without scoring the region.  Of course, you can also headline an actively-dangerous US card when you expect the US to be headlining Defectors, but that&#8217;s much more risky, whereas the downside risk of headlining the scoring card is much lower.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Most beginning players are too eager to headline Defectors.  Not only is it risky on Turn 3, as described above, but more generally, I prefer to headline more aggressively as the US (e.g., <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a>, <a href="#/card/67" title="The US randomly selects 1 card from the USSR’s hand (if available). The US must either play the card or return it to the USSR. If the card is returned, or the USSR has no cards, the US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Grain Sales to Soviets</a>, <a href="#/card/74" title="Remove 4 USSR Influence from any countries NOT in Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">The Voice of America</a>).  Obviously you don&#8217;t always have the luxury of such powerful events, but in general, cancelling the USSR headline doesn&#8217;t seize the initiative and keeps you on your heels.</p>
<p>That having been said, Defectors is a fine headline.  <span style="line-height:24px;">By preventing the headline-AR1 combo, you negate one of the USSR&#8217;s most powerful weapons against you.  </span>If I draw it with a powerful headline I will headline the other card and hold Defectors until next turn.</p>
<p>A quick rules clarification: Defectors, if headlined, will always cancel the USSR headline regardless of Ops value.  The edge case is: if you headline <a href="#/card/5" title="The USSR must randomly discard a card. If the card has a US associated Event, the Event occurs immediately. If the card has a USSR associated Event or an Event applicable to both players, then the card must be discarded without triggering the Event.">Five Year Plan</a> and draw Defectors, Defectors will now only cancel the USSR event if the USSR headline triggers &#8220;after&#8221; the <a href="#/card/5" title="The USSR must randomly discard a card. If the card has a US associated Event, the Event occurs immediately. If the card has a USSR associated Event or an Event applicable to both players, then the card must be discarded without triggering the Event.">Five Year Plan</a> headline.  In other words, if the USSR headlines a 4Ops card, it wouldn&#8217;t be cancelled by the <a href="#/card/5" title="The USSR must randomly discard a card. If the card has a US associated Event, the Event occurs immediately. If the card has a USSR associated Event or an Event applicable to both players, then the card must be discarded without triggering the Event.">Five Year Plan</a> &#8211; Defectors interaction, but any 3 Ops or lower headline will be.</p>
<p>Finally, and this should go without saying, if the USSR has made it to the stage of the Space Race where he can see your headline before he chooses his, <strong>do not </strong>choose Defectors!  All you&#8217;re doing is allowing to discard a US or scoring card of his choice.</p>
