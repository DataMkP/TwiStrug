<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>You often see this played for Ops, because 4 Ops is a lot of Ops, and the USSR ordinarily does not want to drop DEFCON.  If you really wanted to drop DEFCON to 2, you can usually just use the card for a nice coup.</p>
<p>However, there are certain situations where you want to drop DEFCON in the headline phase.  Perhaps the US made an AR7 play and you&#8217;d prefer your AR1 to be spent doing something other than couping.  Perhaps you think the US will drop DEFCON in their headline and a DEFCON victory is one of the few ways you can win the game.</p>
<p>And of course, sometimes you just want 3 VPs.  It&#8217;s a ton of VPs, and towards the end of the Mid War, if you can lower DEFCON, 4 Ops for 3 VPs is a decent trade. Indeed, what usually pushes me to headline it is the combination of the VPs plus the chance for an instant DEFCON win.</p>
<p>The 3VPs take precedence over any card played by the US, so if you play We Will Bury You on at -17VP, and the US plays a scoring card worth +10VP on its next AR, We Will Bury You goes first and ends the game before the US scoring card is tabulated.</p>
<p>Note that you can almost always headline this safely, since it is a 4 Ops event, meaning the only possible US headline that would take precedence and drop DEFCON is <a href="#/card/89" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1 and the US receives 2 VP. The US may place influence or make Realignment rolls, using this card, if South Korea is US controlled.">Soviets Shoot Down KAL-007*</a>7.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A DEFCON suicide card almost all of the time, and even when it isn&#8217;t automatic suicide, 3VP is a lot to give up.  I almost always send this to space.  You could theoretically use this as a way to drop DEFCON in the headline if you have <a href="#/card/32" title="Play this card simultaneously with a card containing an opponent’s associated Event. The opponent’s associated Event is canceled but you may use the Operations value of the opponent’s card to conduct Operations. This Event cannot be played during the Headline Phase.">UN Intervention</a> in your hand, but you&#8217;d probably prefer to just use <a href="#/card/32" title="Play this card simultaneously with a card containing an opponent’s associated Event. The opponent’s associated Event is canceled but you may use the Operations value of the opponent’s card to conduct Operations. This Event cannot be played during the Headline Phase.">UN Intervention</a> with this for the 4 Ops.</p>
