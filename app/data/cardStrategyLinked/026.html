<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 1<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>As a DEFCON suicide card, this card is a problem.  Because it allows the US to conduct Operations on your turn, if DEFCON is 2, then the US can coup a battleground (specifically, a Mid War region battleground due to DEFCON restrictions) to lower DEFCON to 1 and lose you the game.</p>
<p>The only easy way to get rid of this card is in the Early War, if you are fortunate enough to draw it before you have influence in a Mid War battleground.  Then you can play it whenever you want (preferably as the last card in your hand, but if you delay too long the US may play <a href="#/card/8" title="Remove all US Influence from Cuba. USSR adds sufficient Influence in Cuba for Control.">Fidel*</a>!), and even at DEFCON 2 it won&#8217;t cost you the game.</p>
<p>If you draw it and you do have influence in a Mid War battleground, well, then you&#8217;ve not got a lot of good options.  You can play it on AR1 if DEFCON is still 3, allowing the US the coup and revealing your whole hand.  You can take advantage of <a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a> to get out of it, since then the CIA Created coup won&#8217;t lose you the game.  You can space it if you are under <a href="#/card/51" title="All Operations cards played by the USSR, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their Operations value (to a maximum of 4 Operations per card).">Brezhnev Doctrine*</a>.  You can play it with <a href="#/card/32" title="Play this card simultaneously with a card containing an opponent’s associated Event. The opponent’s associated Event is canceled but you may use the Operations value of the opponent’s card to conduct Operations. This Event cannot be played during the Headline Phase.">UN Intervention</a>, but then you can&#8217;t hold a card to next turn, and you might need to do that if you&#8217;re dealing with other bad US cards.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="#/card/62" title="The US reveals their hand of cards. The USSR may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Lone Gunman*</a>, I do not usually hold this turn to turn, waiting for a better chance to discard it.  I usually just play it on AR1, because there are too many things that can cause me to discard a card from my hand, which would lose me the game if I don&#8217;t have <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a>.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Because of how bad it is for the Soviets to draw this, I always play this for Operations before the Turn 3 reshuffle.</p>
<p>In the Mid War, between Turns 3 and 6, there&#8217;s still a chance the USSR will draw it if I play CIA for Operations.  So I&#8217;ll usually play it for Ops.  But if I have literally no other headline choice, or if I desperately need to conduct some Ops / drop DEFCON in the headline, then CIA is a good choice for the headline.</p>
<p>If I draw it on Turn 7, though, then the USSR isn&#8217;t ever going to draw it, and playing it for the event is strictly superior to playing it for Ops.  I will usually headline it (though there are tons of great US headlines at this point).</p>
<p>This card means that I&#8217;m willing to trigger <a href="#/card/8" title="Remove all US Influence from Cuba. USSR adds sufficient Influence in Cuba for Control.">Fidel*</a> on Turns 1 or 2 because it&#8217;ll make CIA unplayable if they draw it.  On Turn 3 I&#8217;ll probably space it unless I know the USSR is still holding on to CIA and has no other influence in the Mid War regions.</p>
