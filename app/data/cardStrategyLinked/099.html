<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Like a much weaker <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a>, except with a 1 VP bonus and not cancellable by <a href="#/card/83" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to Argentina and remove all USSR Influence from the United Kingdom. The US receives 1 VP. This Event prevents the “#7 – Socialist Governments” card from being played as an Event.">The Iron Lady*</a>.  It is worth playing if the VP matters for <a href="#/card/100" title="If the DEFCON level is 2, the player may immediately end the game after giving their opponent 6 VP. How about a nice game of chess?">Wargames*</a> or if the influence loss affects scoring.  A decent headline in the Late War.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>If your European countries are overcontrolled (and you have nothing to fear from the event), then it&#8217;s often worth losing a VP to have 3 Ops.  But if you&#8217;re just going to spend your Action Round repairing the damage done by the event, you may as well send this to space and save the VP.</p>
