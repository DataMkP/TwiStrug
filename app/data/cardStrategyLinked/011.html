<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>This is one of those cards that is more effective as a threat than if actually played.  Korean War only gets worse for you as time goes on.  So although you do want to hold the threat of it over the US&#8217;s head, unlike <a href="#/card/10" title="Unless the US immediately discards a card with an Operations value of 3 or more, remove all US Influence from West Germany.">Blockade*</a>, you can&#8217;t afford to punt it away on Turn 3 and hope for a late-game Korea flip, since by that time Japan and Taiwan will almost certainly have been filled up.</p>
<p>Given the importance of South Korea, try to take it without needing to chance the Korean War event &#8212; ideally with a 4Ops directly.  If you can&#8217;t spare a 4Ops card, you can just stick in 2 Ops to bring it to 1/2.  If the US counters to the point where you can&#8217;t win an Ops war, you can trigger Korean War for a decent chance at stealing the country.  Usually, though, the US player is sufficiently scared of Korean War that it won&#8217;t contest South Korea, and then you can just go ahead and use the 2 Ops of the War to take South Korea outright.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>You usually want to play Korean War as fast as you can.  South Korea is critical to your chances in Asia, and you can&#8217;t keep the threat of the card looming around forever.  Sooner or later, the Korean War is going to happen, and you&#8217;re better off triggering it earlier than later; when played at 1/0, if you win, you get South Korea to 3/0, and if you lose, you can bring it to 2/1.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="#/card/13" title="Pan-Arab Coalition invades Israel. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for Israel, if it is US controlled, and for every US controlled country adjacent to Israel. On a modified die roll of 4-6, the USSR receives 2 VP and replaces all US Influence in Israel with USSR Influence. The USSR adds 2 to its Military Operations Track. This Event cannot be used after the “#65 – Camp David Accords” Event has been played.">Arab-Israeli War</a> or <a href="#/card/24" title="India invades Pakistan or vice versa (player’s choice). Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every enemy controlled country adjacent to the target of the invasion (India or Pakistan). On a modified die roll of 4-6, the player receives 2 VP and replaces all the opponent’s Influence in the target country with their Influence. The player adds 2 to its Military Operations Track.">Indo-Pakistani War</a>, it is not worth it to build up South Korea&#8217;s neighbors before risking Korean War.  Building up Japan and Taiwan is a huge waste of Early War Ops, and in the case of Japan, might be totally wasted (given <a href="#/card/27" title="The US adds sufficient Influence to Japan for Control. The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against Japan.">US/Japan Mutual Defense Pact*</a>).</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t draw Korean War, you&#8217;re in a difficult position.  Typically, I&#8217;ll drop at least 1 influence into South Korea so that the USSR can&#8217;t take it with a 4 Ops card, and then after US/Japan comes out or the USSR is tempted into using Korean War for Ops elsewhere, I&#8217;ll take over South Korea.</p>
