<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p>An ostensibly neutral event that in practice is of far more benefit to the US than the USSR.  The event accomplishes several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It lowers DEFCON to 2, so as a headline it is useful to deny the USSR a battleground coup;</li>
<li>It prevents the opponent from further coups without removing influence from Turkey/West Germany or Cuba.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, as US, it is not usually a big deal to remove two from Turkey or West Germany: you&#8217;ll almost always have at least two influence in one of those two countries, and removing influence is not a big deal for either of them.</p>
<p>As USSR, however, this event is very problematic if <a href="#/card/8" title="Remove all US Influence from Cuba. USSR adds sufficient Influence in Cuba for Control.">Fidel*</a> hasn&#8217;t been triggered.  If you don&#8217;t have influence in Cuba, then you can&#8217;t remove it, and so you are essentially locked out of coups for the rest of the turn.  This has a number of effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The US is able to play <a href="#/card/62" title="The US reveals their hand of cards. The USSR may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Lone Gunman*</a>, which is no longer a DEFCON suicide card;</li>
<li>The US can play <a href="#/card/107" title="The USSR may perform a Coup Attempt, using this card’s Operations value, against a non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa. The USSR may perform a second Coup Attempt, against a different non-Battleground country in Central America, South America or Africa, if the first Coup Attempt removed any US Influence from the target country.">Che</a> without repercussion;</li>
<li>The US can raise DEFCON (via <a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a> or <a href="#/card/46" title="Set the DEFCON level to any level desired (1-5). The player adds 5 to its Military Operations Track.">How I Learned to Stop Worrying*</a>) and then coup away freely;</li>
<li>The USSR is unable to play DEFCON-raising cards (in particular the USSR is now unable to trigger <a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a> or <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a>) without allowing the US several easy coups.</li>
<li>The US will certainly earn at least 2 Mil Ops VPs, and possibly more if they can raise DEFCON;</li>
<li>The US can spread freely through non-battlegrounds without fear of being couped.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the USSR can reap some of these benefits as well (it is nice not to have to worry about <a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a>!), but it is rare for the US to have no influence in either West Germany or Turkey.</p>
<p>Even if the USSR does control Cuba, a Cuban Missile Crisis headline is still pretty annoying, because losing 2 influence in Cuba makes it quite vulnerable.</p>
<p>Finally, Cuban Missile Crisis is a decent headline if you anticipate that your opponent&#8217;s headline will lower DEFCON and be subsequent to yours.  For example, as US, if the USSR headlines <a href="#/card/20" title="This player sponsors the Olympics. The opponent must either participate or boycott. If the opponent participates, each player rolls a die and the sponsor adds 2 to their roll. The player with the highest modified die roll receives 2 VP (reroll ties). If the opponent boycotts, degrade the DEFCON level by 1 and the sponsor may conduct Operations as if they played a 4 Ops card.">Olympic Games</a> (or <a href="#/card/49" title="Exchange this card for your opponent’s highest value Operations card. If 2 or more cards are tied, opponent chooses. If the exchanged card contains an Event applicable to yourself or both players, it occurs immediately. If it contains an opponent’s Event, use the Operations value (no Event). The opponent must use this card for Operations during their next action round.">Missile Envy</a>, and you hold <a href="#/card/50" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. Unless the #32 UN Intervention card is played as an Event on the US’s next action round, the USSR receives 3 VP.">We Will Bury You*</a>), then a Cuban Missile Crisis headline will win you the game.</p>
<p>A couple of rules pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The influence removal is not an Action and can be done at any time. (It is unclear whether you can actually do this in the middle of your opponent&#8217;s Action, i.e., after he announces an intent to coup or realign Cuba, but this is probably an area better suited for sportsmanship than explicit timing rules.)</li>
<li>The Cuban Missile Crisis win condition takes precedence over a DEFCON-lowering coup, so <a href="#/card/62" title="The US reveals their hand of cards. The USSR may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Lone Gunman*</a> is no longer a DEFCON suicide card if the USSR is under its effect and cannot cancel it.  (Presumably Lee Harvey Oswald is unable to assassinate Kennedy until he has successfully resolved the Crisis.)</li>
<li>The text of <a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a> (which confusingly reads &#8220;Does not affect Cuban Missile Crisis&#8221;) simply means that a US player with <a href="#/card/41" title="US Operations used for Coup Attempts in Battleground countries, for the remainder of this turn, do not degrade the DEFCON level. This card’s Event does not apply to any Event that would affect the DEFCON level (ex. the “#40 – Cuban Missile Crisis” Event).">Nuclear Subs*</a> is not immune from the effects of the Cuban Missile Crisis.</li>
<li>Cuban Missile Crisis applies to all coups, including &#8220;free&#8221; coups (through <a href="#/card/47" title="Add 2 Influence to a single country in Central or South America. The player may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in either Central or South America using the Operations value of this card.">Junta</a> or <a href="#/card/96" title="Add 3 US Influence to East Germany. The US may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in Europe using the Operations value of this card. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#55 – Willy Brandt” Event.">Tear Down this Wall*</a>).</li>
</ul>
