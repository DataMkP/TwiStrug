<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 1<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p>This is a nicely thematic card, though not that meaningful to the Cold War overall.  Assuming both players advance to at least the first spot on the Space Race, being first is a 2VP swing plus a little bit better chance at getting the other Space Race benefits.  1 Op for 2VPs is a pretty good trade (compare <a href="#/card/60" title="The USSR receives 1 VP. If the “#32 – UN Intervention” Event is played later this turn, either by the US or the USSR, the USSR receives an additional 1 VP.">U2 Incident*</a>), but Ops and Action Rounds are a precious commodity in the Early War.  Even a single Op is often enough of an Action Round in the Early War, as there are many times when you just want to establish access (e.g., a US play into Malaysia).</p>
<p>More commonly, this is a good headline candidate if you have nothing better.  It&#8217;s a nice headline for USSR especially, if the threat of <a href="#/card/103" title="The US may play this card during the Headline Phase in order to cancel the USSR Headline Event (including a scoring card). The canceled card is placed into the discard pile. If this card is played by the USSR during its action round, the US gains 1 VP.">Defectors</a> is still out there.</p>
<p>It does not take up your normal Space Race slot for the turn, so you should examine the probabilities on the board if you are going to use this and Space Race a card.  Obviously you would prefer to use this on one of the VP spaces that succeed on only 1-3 instead of 1-4.</p>
<p>Captured Nazi Scientist&#8217;s event becomes increasingly valuable if it survives to the Mid War.  In addition, if neither player has advanced much on the Space Race, it is helpful if you are desperate to space multiple cards.  Playing CNS and then spacing a problem card can accelerate you to Animal in Space with 2/3 probability, allowing to space one more problem card.</p>
<p>As always, there is the risk of advancing <em>too far</em> on the Space Race track.  This is more of a problem for the USSR: it&#8217;s nice to earn 2VPs and see the enemy headline first, but not so nice when you are unable to space Voice of America or <a href="#/card/67" title="The US randomly selects 1 card from the USSR’s hand (if available). The US must either play the card or return it to the USSR. If the card is returned, or the USSR has no cards, the US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Grain Sales to Soviets</a>.</p>
