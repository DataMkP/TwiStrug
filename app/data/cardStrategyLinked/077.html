<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>The standard way to get rid of this is to play it on the last Action Round, when hopefully the US has already taken care of all its problematic cards and has nothing left to discard.</p>
<p>But before you do so, you should consider whether it&#8217;s possible that a) the US knows you have it, or b) the US is still holding on to <a href="#/card/62" title="The US reveals their hand of cards. The USSR may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Lone Gunman*</a> or a bad scoring card.  Many experienced US players sometimes hold onto bad cards in the Mid War in hopes of a USSR Ask Not&#8230; that will save them from <a href="#/card/62" title="The US reveals their hand of cards. The USSR may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Lone Gunman*</a> / bad scoring cards.</p>
<p>The best &#8220;double agent&#8221; trick here is if the US sees you have Ask Not&#8230; in your hand (via <a href="#/card/26" title="The USSR reveals their hand of cards for this turn. The US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">CIA Created*</a>), assumes you&#8217;ll play it, and then you instead make a vicious AR7 play that forces a response from them using the very card they had hoped to discard.</p>
<p>Regardless, I rarely space this event.  I really don&#8217;t want the US to draw it in their hand, even in the Late War.  Sooner or later there&#8217;ll be a time when you can safely play this on AR7 knowing that there is not much the US can discard.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>An absolute life-saver for the US, and potentially one of the most powerful cards in the game depending on what you&#8217;re discarding.  When I draw this, I hold onto it from turn to turn, potentially even using <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a> to hold more bad cards, so that I can assemble together the worst possible hand to discard.  Generally this means <a href="#/card/62" title="The US reveals their hand of cards. The USSR may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Lone Gunman*</a> and bad scoring cards, plus some combination of unpleasant USSR events like <a href="#/card/50" title="Degrade the DEFCON level by 1. Unless the #32 UN Intervention card is played as an Event on the US’s next action round, the USSR receives 3 VP.">We Will Bury You*</a>, <a href="#/card/56" title="Remove all US Influence from 2 of the following countries: Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan. This Event cannot be used after the “#110 – AWACS Sale to Saudis” Event has been played.">Muslim Revolution</a>, and <a href="#/card/61" title="The USSR receives 1 VP for Control of each of the following countries: Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Gulf States, Venezuela. This Event cannot be used after the “#86 – North Sea Oil” Event has been played.">OPEC</a>.  (Yes, this means that I am holding onto President Kennedy&#8217;s inaugural speech to get rid of Lee Harvey Oswald.  Got a problem, history?)  If there&#8217;s anything I can even remotely deal with, I will try to deal with it without enlisting the services of President Kennedy.</p>
<p>When I do finally discard to Ask Not&#8230;, I usually also discard weak low Ops neutral events (goodbye, <a href="#/card/45" title="Both players roll a die. Each player receives +1 to the die roll for each Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) they Dominate or Control. The player with the highest modified die roll receives 2 VP and may degrade or improve the DEFCON level by 1 (do not reroll ties).">Summit</a>), or sometimes even low Ops US events if they aren&#8217;t helpful (e.g., <a href="#/card/72" title="Remove all USSR Influence from Egypt and add 1 US Influence to Egypt.">Sadat Expels Soviets*</a> if I already control Egypt).  Sometimes I&#8217;ll hold onto a high Ops starred USSR event that I don&#8217;t mind triggering, or would rather trigger than send back into the deck, but those are rare.  U-2 Incident and <a href="#/card/58" title="If the US has the “#6 – The China Card” card, the US must give the card to the USSR (face up and available to be played). If the USSR already has “#6 – The China Card” card, the USSR receives 1 VP.">Cultural Revolution*</a> are perhaps the only ones that comes to mind.</p>
<p>If I don&#8217;t have Ask Not&#8230;, I try to keep it in my mind.  If holding <a href="#/card/62" title="The US reveals their hand of cards. The USSR may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">Lone Gunman*</a> or a  killer scoring card, I will sometimes hold onto it until AR7 (as described above) and hope for a miracle discard.</p>
<p>If somehow Ask Not&#8230; ends up in the discard, remember that it is potentially a great target for <a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a> and/or <a href="#/card/85" title="If the US is ahead on the Space Race Track, the US player uses this Event to look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card and play it immediately as an Event.">Star Wars*</a> if necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, keep in mind that Ask Not is potentially a suicide card &#8212; not DEFCON suicide, but if you draw more scoring cards than you have Action Rounds available.  And even if it isn&#8217;t immediate suicide, discarding when you don&#8217;t need to at the end of a turn can sometimes force you into doing something that you would not rather do.  Exercise caution, therefore, when you are given the option of discarding with just two cards and one play left.</p>
