<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take very long for a USSR player to learn that Japan is not a very communist-friendly country.  Given that you&#8217;ll never get Japan anyway, this card is usually just a free 4 Ops card, though it can be rather annoying if you&#8217;re trying to use those 4 Ops to take over some other Asia battleground!  Of course, if the US has already taken Japan for some reason, then it is a truly free 4 Ops card because you were never going to coup or realign Japan anyway.</p>
<p>The two interactions worth noting: if you have <a href="#/card/1" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: 9; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Asia Scoring</a>/<a href="#/card/11" title="North Korea invades South Korea. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every US controlled country adjacent to South Korea. On a modified die roll of 4-6, the USSR receives 2 VP and replaces all US Influence in South Korea with USSR Influence. The USSR adds 2 to its Military Operations Track.">Korean War*</a> (or know that <a href="#/card/1" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: 9; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Asia Scoring</a>/<a href="#/card/11" title="North Korea invades South Korea. Roll a die and subtract (-1) from the die roll for every US controlled country adjacent to South Korea. On a modified die roll of 4-6, the USSR receives 2 VP and replaces all US Influence in South Korea with USSR Influence. The USSR adds 2 to its Military Operations Track.">Korean War*</a> is going to be triggered this turn), it is obviously to your advantage to hold onto US/Japan until after those are played.  I have had situations where the US player is forced to score a Asia Domination for me on his final Action Round because he thought I would play US/Japan for him.</p>
<p>There is one situation where you might try to defy the Defense Pact: if US/Japan is discarded on Turn 3, <a href="#/card/1" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: 9; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Asia Scoring</a> has yet to come out, and Japan remains at 1/0, it may be worthwhile to steal a Asia Domination by taking Japan with <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a>.  After all, if Japan gets you Domination (or denies it to the US), then it&#8217;s worth a total of 6VP (4 for Domination, 1 for battleground, and 1 for adjacency).  There&#8217;s about a 50/50 chance that you&#8217;ll lose it all when US/Japan comes back out somewhere in Turns 7-10, but 6VP is a pretty big chunk of VP&#8230;</p>
<p>As a footnote, if you&#8217;re teaching the game to a new USSR player, you should absolutely advise him of the existence of this card, lest he be forced this lesson the hard way like so many other Soviet Premiers (including yours truly).</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Unless the USSR has actually taken over Japan—a very rare occurrence—this is never worth playing for the event.  Even if you need Japan, you can just play it for Ops and put 3 into Japan and 1 somewhere else.  And if you don&#8217;t need Japan, you can usually just play it for Ops elsewhere, content in the knowledge that most USSR players won&#8217;t ever dare play into Japan.</p>
<p>On Turns 1-2, the Ops are probably more important elsewhere than Japan.  But on Turn 3 you should use 3 of the Ops to take Japan and 1 Op elsewhere, to prevent the play described above.  All in all, it is a card you&#8217;d much rather have in the USSR hand.  Depending on where <a href="#/card/1" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 7; Control: 9; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; +1 VP per country controlled that is adjacent to enemy superpower; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Asia Scoring</a> is in the deck, though, you can&#8217;t just wait for US/Japan forever: if US control of Japan is what determines Domination, it is better to waste 3 Ops than lose 5VP&#8230;</p>
