<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>A superb USSR Mid War headline at a time when there is usually very little good news for the USSR.  Compared to <a href="#/card/25" title="All Operations cards played by the US, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their Operations value (to a maximum of 4 Operations per card).">Containment*</a>, it has two disadvantages: first, it comes at a time when there is less opportunity for Ops on the board, and second, if drawn by the US, it has zero effect instead of a minimal effect.</p>
<p>But its great advantage over <a href="#/card/25" title="All Operations cards played by the US, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their Operations value (to a maximum of 4 Operations per card).">Containment*</a> is that it allows the USSR to deal with the irritating Mid War US 1 Op cards: <a href="#/card/70" title="Add a total of 2 US Influence to any countries in Central or South America.">OAS Founded*</a>, <a href="#/card/64" title="Add 1 US Influence to Panama, Costa Rica and Venezuela.">Panama Canal Returned*</a>, <a href="#/card/48" title="If the US controls more Battleground countries than the USSR, the US player uses this Event to poke their opponent in the chest and receive 2 VP!">Kitchen Debates*</a>, and <a href="#/card/72" title="Remove all USSR Influence from Egypt and add 1 US Influence to Egypt.">Sadat Expels Soviets*</a>.  (Sometimes <a href="#/card/26" title="The USSR reveals their hand of cards for this turn. The US may use the Operations value of this card to conduct Operations.">CIA Created*</a>, if you are unlucky.)  It makes those events eligible for the Space Race and alternatively makes it much easier to mitigate their effects.  (The latter is also true for <a href="#/card/76" title="If the USSR has the “#6 – The China Card” card, the USSR must give the card to the US (face up and available for play). If the US already has the “#6 – The China Card” card, add a total of 4 US Influence to any countries in Asia (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">Ussuri River Skirmish*</a>.)</p>
<p>Occasionally I will hold this from turn to turn if my hand is not particularly suited for Brezhnev Doctrine (e.g., many scoring cards or no US events).  But I will always headline it sooner or later.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Play it on the last Action Round and be glad you drew it.</p>
