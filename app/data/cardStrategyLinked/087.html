<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>An outstanding event.  The standard effect is very strong (like <a href="#/card/76" title="If the USSR has the “#6 – The China Card” card, the USSR must give the card to the US (face up and available for play). If the US already has the “#6 – The China Card” card, add a total of 4 US Influence to any countries in Asia (adding no more than 2 Influence per country).">Ussuri River Skirmish*</a>), and the enhanced effect is irreparable in a single Action Round.</p>
<p>The Reformer can be used either on offense, defense, or both.  It defends against the US Late War incursion into Eastern Europe, and it can place a significant amount of influence into the Western European battlegrounds.  West Germany is probably too difficult to flip because of its stability, but Italy and France are both vulnerable.  Plus, you can dump extra influence into US non-battlegrounds and break/gain Domination (and in the case of Canada, pause <a href="#/card/106" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country containing US Influence, at the end of each Action Round, if Canada is US-controlled and the DEFCON level moved to 2 during that Action Round. This Event is canceled by the “#42 – Quagmire” Event.">NORAD*</a>).</p>
<p>That being said, do not hold this too long waiting for that negative VP score, as otherwise the US might draw and be able to play <a href="#/card/90" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and the USSR receives 2 VP. The USSR may make Realignment rolls or add Influence, using this card, if the “#87 – The Reformer” Event has already been played.">Glasnost*</a> as a -2VP <a href="#/card/57" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and then conduct Operations using the Operations value of this card.">ABM Treaty</a>.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Send Mr. Gorbachev to space, every time.  Improving <a href="#/card/90" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 1 and the USSR receives 2 VP. The USSR may make Realignment rolls or add Influence, using this card, if the “#87 – The Reformer” Event has already been played.">Glasnost*</a> is very bad for you, and adding 4-6 influence with only 3 Ops to counter is problematic as well.</p>
