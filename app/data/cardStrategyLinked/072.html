<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Another in a long line of annoying, unspaceable US Mid War 1 Op cards.  Coupled with <a href="#/card/65" title="The US receives 1 VP and adds 1 Influence to Israel, Jordan and Egypt. This Event prevents the “#13 – Arab-Israeli War” card from being played as an Event.">Camp David Accords*</a>, Sadat gives Egypt to the US, throwing a wrench in your <a href="#/card/3" title="Presence: 3; Domination: 5; Control: 7; +1 VP per controlled Battleground country in Region; MAY NOT BE HELD!">Middle East Scoring</a> or <a href="#/card/61" title="The USSR receives 1 VP for Control of each of the following countries: Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Gulf States, Venezuela. This Event cannot be used after the “#86 – North Sea Oil” Event has been played.">OPEC</a> plans.  But you don&#8217;t really have any other options &#8212; sometime in the Mid War, Sadat almost certainly will be triggered.  So it&#8217;s better to plan for him in advance: if the US breaks control of Egypt with <a href="#/card/65" title="The US receives 1 VP and adds 1 Influence to Israel, Jordan and Egypt. This Event prevents the “#13 – Arab-Israeli War” card from being played as an Event.">Camp David Accords*</a>, I don&#8217;t bother reinforcing it if I&#8217;m going to be expelled by Sadat soon afterwards.</p>
<p>For the most part Sadat can be effectively neutralized by keeping either <a href="#/card/15" title="Add 2 USSR Influence to Egypt. The US removes half, rounded up, of its Influence from Egypt.">Nasser*</a> or <a href="#/card/56" title="Remove all US Influence from 2 of the following countries: Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan. This Event cannot be used after the “#110 – AWACS Sale to Saudis” Event has been played.">Muslim Revolution</a> in the deck.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>This is a great event if the USSR controls Egypt, and almost always worth triggering.  It is better to play <a href="#/card/65" title="The US receives 1 VP and adds 1 Influence to Israel, Jordan and Egypt. This Event prevents the “#13 – Arab-Israeli War” card from being played as an Event.">Camp David Accords*</a> first, then Sadat, to keep the Sword of <del>Damocles </del>Sadat hanging over the USSR&#8217;s head.</p>
