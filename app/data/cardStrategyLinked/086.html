<p>I try to save North Sea Oil for the end of the Turn, to reduce the time the US has to prepare for an AR8.  It&#8217;s not generally worth sending to space, except on Turn 10, where an AR8 is especially uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The event is a lot less threatening when the US does not have <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a> and you&#8217;re able to use <a href="#/card/98" title="The US reveals their hand of cards, face-up, for the remainder of the turn and the USSR discards a card from the US hand.">Aldrich Ames Remix*</a> and/or <a href="#/card/92" title="The player’s opponent must randomly discard 1 card from their hand. If the “#82 – Iranian Hostage Crisis” Event has already been played, a US player (if applicable) must randomly discard 2 cards from their hand.">Terrorism</a> to cut the US hand size.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>North Sea Oil probably makes most sense as a headline, but in a pinch you could play it during the turn.  The point is to give up one of your regular Action Rounds (or headline) and 3 Ops in exchange for two consecutive Action Rounds at the end of the turn, which can be used for all kinds of nefarious purposes.  The <a href="#/card/61" title="The USSR receives 1 VP for Control of each of the following countries: Egypt, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Gulf States, Venezuela. This Event cannot be used after the “#86 – North Sea Oil” Event has been played.">OPEC</a> block is just a nice bonus.</p>
<p>It is naturally most effective on Turn 10.  It also tends to be better when you have <a href="#/card/6" title="This card begins the game with the USSR. When played, the player receives +1 Operations to the Operations value of this card if it uses all its Operations in Asia. It is passed to the opponent once played. A player receives 1 VP for holding this card at the end of Turn 10.">The China Card</a> or <a href="#/card/43" title="Improve the DEFCON level by 2. For the remainder of the turn, both players receive -1 to all Coup Attempt rolls. The player of this card’s Event may look through the discard pile, pick any 1 non-scoring card, reveal it to their opponent and then place the drawn card into their hand.">SALT Negotiations*</a>, both of which would allow you to hold an extra card so you don&#8217;t have to play every card in your hand.</p>
<p>In the Late War, I try (if reasonable) to not hold a problematic card and space it earlier in the turn instead.  This allows me to take advantage of a USSR AR7 play of North Sea Oil.  (Reminiscent of the US approach to a possible USSR <a href="#/card/25" title="All Operations cards played by the US, for the remainder of this turn, receive +1 to their Operations value (to a maximum of 4 Operations per card).">Containment*</a> in the Early War.)</p>
