<p>Depending on whether Special Relationship is <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event. This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a>-activated, this can be either a minor annoyance or an irritating source of US VPs.</p>
<p>The best case scenario is when the US doesn&#8217;t control the UK.  This will happen somewhat naturally from <a href="#/card/28" title="Remove a total of 4 US Influence from France, the United Kingdom and Israel (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">Suez Crisis*</a>; the US usually has too many priorities for its influence than to repair the UK early on, and so you can often get away with a no-effect Special Relationship.</p>
<p>If the US does control the UK, but <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event. This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a> is not in effect, then look to its neighbors.  If the US already controls both France and Canada, then you can consider the influence to be moot and safely disregard the event text.  If they don&#8217;t control Canada, then try to delay playing Special Relationship until they do.  In the worst case scenario, where you control France, you&#8217;ll have to spend at least one Op of Special Relationship to repair its damage.</p>
<p>Once Special Relationship is <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event. This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a>-activated, it becomes much more powerful.  A competent US player will never trigger <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe.

This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a>, but you almost certainly will, because its 4 Ops are too much to pass up.  So if you hold both in the same hand, you should play Special Relationship first.  (As discussed in the <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event.

This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Warsaw Pact Formed*</a> and <a href="#/card/23" title="Add 1 US Influence to each of any 7 non-USSR controlled countries in Western Europe. This Event allows the “#21 – NATO” card to be played as an Event.">Marshall Plan*</a>, so you can punt <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe.

<p>If you do hold Special Relationship in a post-<a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe.

<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>If Special Relationship is not <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe.

This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a>-activated, then there is obviously no point to playing it for the event, since you can (almost) always use its 2 Ops to duplicate its effect (the exception being if you are under <a href="#/card/31" title="All Operations cards played by the opponent, for the remainder of this turn, receive -1 to their Operations value (to a minimum value of 1 Operations point).">Red Scare/Purge</a> and want to use Special Relationship to break USSR control of France).</p>
<p>If Special Relationship is <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event. This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a>-activated, then it becomes a somewhat tempting event: the 2VP is quite nice by itself, and the two US influence is helpful if the USSR controls Italy or France.</p>
<p>You should never, however, play <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event.

<p>The real benefit of Special Relationship is that the USSR is often forced to play it for you.  This is a good reason, therefore, to control the UK: <a href="#/card/28" title="Remove a total of 4 US Influence from France, the United Kingdom and Israel (removing no more than 2 Influence per country).">Suez Crisis*</a> will wipe out one or two influence, and occasionally <a href="#/card/7" title="Remove a total of 3 US Influence from any countries in Western Europe (removing no more than 2 Influence per country). This Event cannot be used after the “#83 – The Iron Lady” Event has been played.">Socialist Governments</a> might take one out of it as well.  I wouldn&#8217;t go out of my way to control the UK, especially if <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe.

<p>Along the same lines, in the Early War, if you do control the UK but <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe.
