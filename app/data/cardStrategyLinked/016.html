<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Being able to remove all US influence in Eastern Europe is <em>vastly</em> superior to adding 5 influence.  It is essentially <a href="#/card/19" title="Remove all USSR Influence from a single uncontrolled country in Europe.">Truman Doctrine*</a> at any time (regardless of control) and in four (Eastern European) countries at once.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I always play Warsaw Pact Formed for Ops in the Early War / Mid War so that I can keep it in the deck.  Its mere presence in the draw deck is a threat to the US, in much the same way that <a href="#/card/19" title="Remove all USSR Influence from a single uncontrolled country in Europe.">Truman Doctrine*</a> deters the USSR from engaging in European Ops wars. Warsaw Pact is your best (and sometimes only) defense against the Late War US onslaught of <a href="#/card/94" title="The US must designate a single Region (Europe, Asia, etc.) that, for the remainder of the turn, the USSR cannot add Influence to using Operations points.">Chernobyl*</a>, <a href="#/card/96" title="Add 3 US Influence to East Germany. The US may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in Europe using the Operations value of this card. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#55 – Willy Brandt” Event.">Tear Down this Wall*</a>, <a href="#/card/29" title="Early or Mid War: Remove 1 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe. Late War: Remove 2 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe.">East European Unrest</a>, <a href="#/card/68" title="Remove 2 USSR Influence from Poland and add 1 US Influence to Poland. This Event allows the “#101 – Solidarity” card to be played as an Event.">John Paul II Elected Pope*</a>, and <a href="#/card/101" title="Add 3 US Influence to Poland. This card requires prior play of the “#68 – John Paul II Elected Pope” Event in order to be played as an Event.">Solidarity*</a>.</p>
<p>Once you get to Turn 7 and draw Warsaw Pact, it is then a common USSR hold card in case of European emergency.  Since any card played or discarded on Turn 7 or later is likely not going to return to the game, you must try to keep it in the game for as long as possible. As long the US player is convinced that the Warsaw Pact may yet be formed, he will be very hesitant about investing into Europe, thereby nullifying one of the great US advantages in the game.</p>
<p>In the unfortunate event that the US triggers Warsaw Pact Formed in the Early War or Mid War and there is no meaningful US influence to remove, I ordinarily bump East Germany and Poland by 2 each and stick the other influence in Yugoslavia or Czechoslovakia.  (Yugoslavia because I usually start with 1 there, and Czechoslovakia because it could theoretically provide a -1 against a <a href="#/card/96" title="Add 3 US Influence to East Germany. The US may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in Europe using the Operations value of this card. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#55 – Willy Brandt” Event.">Tear Down this Wall*</a> realignment of East Germany or Poland.)</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>If you draw this in the Early War / Mid War, count your blessings.  As US, Warsaw Pact Formed is actually a better draw than most US events (like, say <a href="#/card/5" title="The USSR must randomly discard a card. If the card has a US associated Event, the Event occurs immediately. If the card has a USSR associated Event or an Event applicable to both players, then the card must be discarded without triggering the Event.">Five Year Plan</a>).  Being able to get rid of a critical USSR Late War card is a huge bonus, and by playing it when you have no influence to be removed, you can save yourself a lot of worry and headaches in the Late War.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, an early play of Warsaw Pact Formed means the USSR can no longer dump <a href="#/card/21" title="The USSR cannot make Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls against any US controlled countries in Europe. US controlled countries in Europe cannot be attacked by play of the “#36 – Brush War” Event. This card requires prior play of either the “#16 – Warsaw Pact Formed” or “#23 – Marshall Plan” Event(s) in order to be played as an Event.">NATO*</a> or <a href="#/card/22" title="Add US Influence to either Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, or Czechoslovakia so that it equals the USSR Influence in that country.">Independent Reds*</a> with impunity.</p>
