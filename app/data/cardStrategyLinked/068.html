<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really a problem to deal with influence-wise, since most Soviet Premiers already overprotect Poland with some mixture of <a href="#/card/14" title="Add 1 USSR Influence to each of 4 non-US controlled countries of Eastern Europe.">Comecon*</a>/Warsaw Pact/opening setup influence.</p>
<p>The real issue is <a href="#/card/101" title="Add 3 US Influence to Poland. This card requires prior play of the “#68 – John Paul II Elected Pope” Event in order to be played as an Event.">Solidarity*</a>, which can prove quite annoying later on.  John Paul II won&#8217;t control Poland for the US, but <a href="#/card/101" title="Add 3 US Influence to Poland. This card requires prior play of the “#68 – John Paul II Elected Pope” Event in order to be played as an Event.">Solidarity*</a> (coupled with <a href="#/card/29" title="Early or Mid War: Remove 1 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe. Late War: Remove 2 USSR Influence from 3 countries in Eastern Europe.">East European Unrest</a>) can.</p>
<p>Therefore, at best, this event is only a wash for you, and at worst, it creates further problems for you down the line.  This makes John Paul II a very attractive recruit for the Soviet cosmonaut program.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>For the reasons listed above, I try to trigger John Paul II so that the USSR has to worry about <a href="#/card/101" title="Add 3 US Influence to Poland. This card requires prior play of the “#68 – John Paul II Elected Pope” Event in order to be played as an Event.">Solidarity*</a> later.  It&#8217;s a nice AR7 play, especially if you hold <a href="#/card/19" title="Remove all USSR Influence from a single uncontrolled country in Europe.">Truman Doctrine*</a>, because Poland is not only adjacent to the USSR but also a key realignment modifier on East Germany when <a href="#/card/96" title="Add 3 US Influence to East Germany. The US may make free Coup Attempts or Realignment rolls in Europe using the Operations value of this card. This Event prevents / cancels the effect(s) of the “#55 – Willy Brandt” Event.">Tear Down this Wall*</a> arrives in the Late War.  It gets even better with <a href="#/card/106" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country containing US Influence, at the end of each Action Round, if Canada is US-controlled and the DEFCON level moved to 2 during that Action Round. This Event is canceled by the “#42 – Quagmire” Event.">NORAD*</a> in play, because it provides another good place for <a href="#/card/106" title="Add 1 US Influence to a single country containing US Influence, at the end of each Action Round, if Canada is US-controlled and the DEFCON level moved to 2 during that Action Round. This Event is canceled by the “#42 – Quagmire” Event.">NORAD*</a> influence.</p>
<p>But I wouldn&#8217;t over-invest into Eastern Europe until I&#8217;m sure that Warsaw Pact is safely disposed of.  Trigger John Paul II, make the USSR sweat a little bit, but don&#8217;t immediately pour in influence unless you know you can&#8217;t be thrown out by the Warsaw Pact.</p>
