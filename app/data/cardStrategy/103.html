<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />

<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>As USSR, I only consider the threat of Defectors to be a deterrent when I am risking the loss of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a must-play event with a long-term effect (e.g., Decolonization, De-Stalinization)</li>
<li>a lot of VP (e.g., scoring cards)</li>
<li>a high Ops card on a turn where Ops are scarce (e.g., Red Scare/Purge on Turns 1-2)</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, I usually don&#8217;t particularly care about Defectors.  Headlines like Junta, or a Turn 1 Suez Crisis are great, but not the end of the world if they get cancelled.</p>
<p>As USSR, if I draw Defectors on Turn 1 or 2, I will try to hold it until Turn 3 before playing it for Ops.  This keeps it out of the Turn 3 reshuffle and ensures worry-free headlines for most of the game.  This is analogous to the US holding Decolonization/De-Stalinization until Turn 3, though Defectors is not nearly as important as they are.</p>
<p>A common USSR trick against Defectors is to headline a scoring card for a region that you are being Dominated in.  This is most effective when against a relatively inexperienced US player, and when you haven&#8217;t seen Defectors come out Turns 1 or 2 (meaning it is guaranteed to be in his hand on Turn 3). It is one of the rare ways to discard a scoring card without scoring the region.  Of course, you can also headline an actively-dangerous US card when you expect the US to be headlining Defectors, but that&#8217;s much more risky, whereas the downside risk of headlining the scoring card is much lower.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Most beginning players are too eager to headline Defectors.  Not only is it risky on Turn 3, as described above, but more generally, I prefer to headline more aggressively as the US (e.g., Red Scare/Purge, Grain Sales to Soviets, The Voice of America).  Obviously you don&#8217;t always have the luxury of such powerful events, but in general, cancelling the USSR headline doesn&#8217;t seize the initiative and keeps you on your heels.</p>
<p>That having been said, Defectors is a fine headline.  <span style="line-height:24px;">By preventing the headline-AR1 combo, you negate one of the USSR&#8217;s most powerful weapons against you.  </span>If I draw it with a powerful headline I will headline the other card and hold Defectors until next turn.</p>
<p>A quick rules clarification: Defectors, if headlined, will always cancel the USSR headline regardless of Ops value.  The edge case is: if you headline Five Year Plan and draw Defectors, Defectors will now only cancel the USSR event if the USSR headline triggers &#8220;after&#8221; the Five Year Plan headline.  In other words, if the USSR headlines a 4Ops card, it wouldn&#8217;t be cancelled by the Five Year Plan &#8211; Defectors interaction, but any 3 Ops or lower headline will be.</p>
<p>Finally, and this should go without saying, if the USSR has made it to the stage of the Space Race where he can see your headline before he chooses his, <strong>do not </strong>choose Defectors!  All you&#8217;re doing is allowing to discard a US or scoring card of his choice.</p>
