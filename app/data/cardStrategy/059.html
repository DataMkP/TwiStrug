<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>It is hard for me to imagine when I would ever play this for the event.  Conceivably, if I used Lone Gunman to spy on the US hand, and saw that they had literally a ton of &#8220;War&#8221; cards, then Flower Power would be worth it.  Conceivably.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the benefit is just way too speculative to pass up 4 Ops.  As a 1 Op card, I might take the chance.  As a 4 Ops, you&#8217;d have to be crazy, desperate, or most likely, both.  Like NATO, this is one of those events you have to hope the opponent triggers for you.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Like the USSR, you are probably not going to pass up the 4 Ops from this card.  Unlike the USSR, you&#8217;re going to have deal with its ill effects later on: chances are, you&#8217;ll probably draw at least one or two &#8220;War&#8221; cards and be forced to space them or lose 2 VP per.  Fairly annoying, and everyone has forgotten about Flower Power at one point or another and lost 2 VP without realizing it.</p>
<p>Generally I&#8217;ll just space the War cards, which isn&#8217;t a big deal until you have other cards you want to space as well (or if you&#8217;re Purged).  <a title="Brush War" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/09/04/brush-war/">Brush War</a> is of course the main exception.</p>
<p>Usually I don&#8217;t end up playing An Evil Empire for the event unless I also have a lot of &#8220;War&#8221; cards in hand with An Evil Empire.  And it goes without saying that if you draw Flower Power with &#8220;War&#8221; cards in hand, you should play all the Wars first.</p>
<p>Note that <a title="Arab-Israeli War" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/01/16/arab-israeli-war/">Arab-Israeli War</a>, if prevented by Camp David Accords, does not count for Flower Power and is a safe play.</p>
