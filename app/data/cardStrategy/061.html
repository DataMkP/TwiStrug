<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>OPEC is a bit like an extra Middle East scoring card, except only for you.  It is up to you how many countries you need in order to trigger OPEC: I have done it for 1 VP, but usually I probably wouldn&#8217;t usually trigger it once it is 2 or fewer VPs.  Normally this ends up being around 4-5 VPs; I often hold onto it to see if I can extract some extra value out of it.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>OPEC really is like an extra Middle East scoring card, but unlike a Middle East scoring card, it has 3 Ops and therefore can be spaced.  And indeed, I usually do space it, since it is a rare game indeed where this isn&#8217;t scoring 3+ VPs.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also use the 3 Ops to try to break control of a USSR country to lower OPEC&#8217;s effect.  This is like a <a title="Special Relationship" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/07/18/special-relationship/">Special Relationship</a> null play, but carries the disadvantage that you&#8217;re probably still giving up some VPs.</p>
<p>On Turn 6, this is one of those cards that I make sure to try to hold past the <a title="General Strategy: Reshuffles" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/15/general-strategy-reshuffles/">Turn 7 reshuffle</a> before discarding, since this is particularly bad time to be handing the USSR an extra 4-5 VPs.</p>
<p>Incidentally, any time you see the USSR play into Gulf States, you should be on alert that OPEC is coming.</p>
