<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>One of two excellent Early War US events for the USSR, the other being <a title="Duck and Cover" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/duck-and-cover/">Duck and Cover</a>.  By playing it on your last Action Round, you can discard the one remaining card in your hand, which, conveniently, happens to be a scoring card for a region that you don&#8217;t want to score.  This is the only way for the USSR to get rid of a scoring card without playing it.</p>
<p>Even if you aren&#8217;t using Five Year Plan to discard scoring cards, its discard can be timed to  mitigate the effect of a low-Op US event.  For instance, OAS Founded is a hugely problematic card for the USSR because you only have 1 Op to deal with the 2 US influence it places.  But by playing Five Year Plan when you only have OAS Founded left, you are now able to respond with 3 Ops instead of just 1.  Similar tricks can be performed with most of the other annoying US 1 Op cards (e.g., Sadat Expels Soviets, Truman Doctrine, etc.).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Five Year Plan can be a serious liability in a hand of <a title="General Strategy: DEFCON" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/general-strategy-defcon/">DEFCON suicide cards</a>.  Either you risk playing it early on (hoping the US doesn&#8217;t draw one of the suicide cards), or you&#8217;re forced to treat it as yet another unplayable card in your hand.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Almost always played for operations.  Occasionally played for the event: one possibility is that you know that the USSR is trying to hold a <a title="General Strategy: DEFCON" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/general-strategy-defcon/">DEFCON suicide card</a>, and by cutting their handsize (perhaps in conjunction with other handsize-reducers like Grain Sales to Soviets), you can force them to play it and lose.  If you&#8217;re able to hold onto the China Card and play several discarders against your opponent, you might be able to force a DEFCON victory.  Alternatively, if you&#8217;re desperate, you might play it in hopes of drawing an otherwise game-ending card like Wargames or an unfavorable scoring card.  In the Early War, with excellent card knowledge, you may be able to force out De-Stalinization or Decolonization if you are fortunate.  The event is also more attractive while under Red Scare/Purge, since it slows the USSR down at the cost of only 2 Ops.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you should always play this for operations.  3 Ops is quite valuable in the Early War for the US, and moreover, playing Five Year Plan risks drawing <a title="Duck and Cover" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/duck-and-cover/">Duck and Cover</a> and losing the game by thermonuclear war.</p>
