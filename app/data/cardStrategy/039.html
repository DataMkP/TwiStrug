<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p>Note that it doesn&#8217;t matter whether your opponent has met his Military Operations requirements: all that matters is whether you have, and whether you have more than he does. Usually it will be the USSR that benefits from this event, but a US player with ABM Treaty or something similar can often benefit as well.</p>
<p>Assuming that you will not be playing this for the 1 VP (absent extraordinary circumstances), Arms Race thus becomes a rather straightforward choice between 3 Ops or 3 VPs.  In this, Arms Race is quite unlike most of the Ops-for-VPs events in that it is actually worthwhile: 3 VPs are often superior to 3 Ops, especially late in the Mid War.  (Compare to say, U2 Incident.)</p>
<p>But it depends on how you&#8217;d use those 3 Ops: flipping a battleground, in and of itself, is only worth 2 VPs, but denying or achieving a Domination bonus adds an additional 2-4VPs, depending on the region.  So for example, if you have no other options, Arms Race is better used for Ops if you are flipping a 1-stability African battleground and achieving Domination as a result.  But if you already have Domination, 3 VPs are better than those 3 Ops even if you flip the battleground.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want to wait as long as possible in the turn to decide whether you need Arms Race&#8217;s 3 Ops, or if you can get by without and get the VPs instead.  Of course, it is never so easy in Twilight Struggle &#8212; the longer you wait, the more likely it is that your opponent equals your Mil Ops, at which point the 3 VPs are no longer available to you.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, I tend to play Arms Race for VPs towards the end of the Mid War (even holding it between turns if necessary), and early in the Mid War I hold it until the end of the turn and look for an opportunity to trigger it for VPs.  In the Late War I will almost certainly take the 3 VPs (and actively try for it).</p>
<p>As a final note, Arms Race is often pretty high up on the list of &#8220;lousiest cards to receive through Missile Envy&#8221;, despite the thematic appropriateness.</p>
