<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Along with <a title="Che" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/11/27/che/">Che</a>, Iran-Contra Scandal is one of the most underrated events in the game.  The reason it is so powerful (compared to <a title="Latin American Death Squads" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/11/09/latin-american-death-squads/">Latin American Death Squads</a>) is that the modifier applies to all US realignment rolls, including their rolls on your realignments.  So it&#8217;s not a speculative event: you headline it and then go nuts realigning the US in the Mid War regions.  Suddenly, now that even rolls are favorable, it is a lot easier to find good realignment targets.  No need to hold onto both Colombia and Brazil to realign Venezuela any more; just one of the two will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Play it on your last Action Round, though you can sometimes get away with playing it merely very late if the USSR doesn&#8217;t have time to set up a realignment.</p>
