<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Clearly this is a quality event if the US still controls Iran, a rarity in the Late War.  The Terrorism effect alone is not worth triggering the event, but is a good bonus on top of flipping Iran to you (which is at least a 2VP swing in final scoring, possibly more).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to keep in mind because if you are still attacking Middle East battlegrounds in the Late War (or late in the Mid War), it&#8217;s probably best to go for Egypt and Iraq as opposed to Libya (Reagan Bombs Libya), Saudi Arabia (AWACS Sales to Saudis), Israel (stability too high), or Iran (Iranian Hostage Crisis).</p>
<p>One of the advantages of controlling Iran is that the US will be more willing to play this event, thus allowing you to trigger a double Terrorism to really cripple a US Late War hand.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost certainly worth it to send this to space if you control Iran.  Even if it doesn&#8217;t affect Domination, it definitely is at least 2 VP for Final Scoring, and at least 4 VP if the Middle East gets scored one more time.</p>
<p>Sometimes even when the USSR controls Iran, you might be tempted to space this.  A double Terrorism discard is quite painful, and turning Iran from 0/2 to 0/4 essentially gives up any hope of ever taking the country back.  But it&#8217;s 3 Ops &#8212; so if Iran is already overcontrolled, or if you have no interest in it, then I will risk possible subsequent Terrorism.</p>
