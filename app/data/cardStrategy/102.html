<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p>Towards the end of the game, this area&#8217;s countries are usually dominated by the same superpower, and so the odds of Iran-Iraq War succeeding are rather low.  Unlike earlier Wars, it&#8217;s not commonly played for the Mil Ops, since by this point you should be able to find a non-battleground to coup with the card itself.</p>
<p>The VPs are therefore the only thing about the card that really matters, and you&#8217;ll see people trigger this event when desperate for VPs.  There&#8217;s no downside risk, and if you already control all the countries in the area, then it&#8217;s upwards of a 50% chance of 2 VPs.  (Yes, you may trigger the war even if you control both countries.)</p>
<p>Iraq is typically a more popular target, because its neighbors (Iran/Saudi Arabia/Jordan/Gulf States) are usually less filled than Iran (Iraq/Afghanistan/Pakistan), and because it is a higher stability country.</p>
