<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Almost always worth spacing as the USSR, since it adds 4 influence to low-stability countries and you only have 2 influence with which to respond.  Along with Nuclear Subs, it can flip a USSR-controlled Africa to capitalism very quickly.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Identical to and yet weaker than Decolonization, Colonial Rear Guards doesn&#8217;t usually come out fast enough to lock up Africa or Southeast Asia.  But it&#8217;s still a very strong event: it can be used as a destabilizing headline or AR7 play if the USSR controls Africa and Southeast Asia.  If I don&#8217;t have immediate use for it, I tend to hold it or use it for overprotection insurance influence rather than the 2 Ops.</p>
<p>Normally the influence from this will be dumped into Africa, since Southeast Asia should no longer be very contested.  But I usually put at least one into Thailand (to threaten a China Card takeover), and then perhaps some into Philippines / Malaysia / Indonesia if Southeast Asia will be scored soon and those countries are still uncontrolled.  But the influence usually goes much farther in the 1-stability African battlegrounds.</p>
