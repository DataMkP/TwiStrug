<p>An annoying <a title="The China Card" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/10/31/the-china-card/">China Card</a> event with a choose-your-poison dilemma.  The best solution to this dilemma is to ignore it altogether by sending Nixon to space; if forced to play it, I would usually rather fork over 2 VPs than the China Card, but of course this may depend on the state of the scoring track.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A good event.  2 Ops for 2 VPs is a strong trade, particularly towards the end of the Mid War, and the China Card itself is worth at least 2 VPs (because possession at the end of the game gives +1 VP for you rather than your opponent).  The main drawback is that you only get the China Card facedown, thus depriving you of an Action Round of Ops, but if you have an AR to spare, it is worth playing.</p>
