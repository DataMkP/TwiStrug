<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>The Voice of America is a wholly unplayable event for the USSR.  It ranks alongside DEFCON suicide cards in terms of Space Race priority; at least with Duck and Cover, you could headline it or play it on AR1 when DEFCON is still at 3.  The Voice of America is never safe for the USSR to play and never mitigatable, not even if boosted with Brezhnev Doctrine.</p>
<p>The event is at its worst when you just made inroads into a region and VOA eliminates you entirely: for instance, it is a perfect antidote to a Mid War De-Stalinization.  It is therefore imperative for you to try to establish footholds of 5 influence (or one country with 3 influence) whenever and wherever you fear VOA.  Losing 4 influence is tough but at least salvageable; losing access entirely can decide the game.  This means, for instance, that you cannot just rely on 2 Venezuela / 2 Brazil as your sole foothold in South America, or 1 Angola / 1 Zaire / 1 Nigeria as your sole foothold in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>As indicated above, The Voice of America is best when you can use it to knock the USSR out of a region entirely.  Sometimes such a situation will naturally fall into your lap; other times, you can manufacture such situations with an eye towards VOA as the knockout blow.  A couple of strategic coups and realignments can reduce the USSR down to what he thinks is a last stand, before VOA takes him out by the knees.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t eliminate access, then the next best effect of VOA is in countries where you have influence and can immediately control or threaten to immediately control.  It is a good way to simultaneously threaten two regions at once and force the USSR to choose between them.</p>
<p>VOA is one of the best AR7 plays.  In particular, VOA is at its most devastating on Turn 10 AR7.  If I draw VOA in the Late War, I will do everything possible to make sure that I can hold it until then for a crippling final blow.</p>
<p>It is somewhat athematic that VOA cannot affect Europe, but I suppose the event is strong enough without it being a quasi-East European Unrest as well.</p>
