<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>An uninteresting event.  Usually it&#8217;s 2 Ops vs 1 VP, and usually that means the 2 Ops are more helpful (especially as you surely have more pressing US events to space).  Wargames and Final Scoring should factor into this generally straightforward decision.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>In some cute instances you can put a little more influence into Libya, boosting it to 2/2 and prompting the USSR to respond to 2/4, pushing this up to 2 VP.  But on the whole it&#8217;s not a particularly interesting event: sometimes you&#8217;ll want 2 Ops, and sometimes you just want 1 VP (particularly when concerned about Wargames).</p>
