<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>If <a title="The Reformer" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/12/07/the-reformer/">The Reformer</a> hasn&#8217;t been played, Glasnost is probably not getting played as an event unless you really want 2 VP for Wargames or autovictory.  4 Ops is a lot to give up, and raising DEFCON is usually inconvenient since you&#8217;re just giving the US a battleground coup.  If you do want the 2 VP that badly, then headlining it is probably your best option under these circumstances.</p>
<p>If The Reformer has been played, then Glasnost becomes a great headline.  Playing it in an Action Round is still a little inconvenient, because you can&#8217;t use the event to coup DEFCON back down to 2 in the same Action Round.  But the chance to play 4 Operations in the headline <em>and</em> get 2 VP is definitely worth starting AR1 at DEFCON 4.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>If The Reformer hasn&#8217;t been played, then this event turns into a quasi-<a title="ABM Treaty" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/10/23/abm-treaty/">ABM Treaty</a> for the US, albeit one that costs 2 VP.  Whether this is a worthwhile investment depends on the situation, of course, but if you can use it to flip a battleground it probably pays for itself.</p>
<p>If The Reformer has been played, then you&#8217;ll almost certainly send this to space.  It&#8217;s not a <a title="General Strategy: DEFCON" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/general-strategy-defcon/">DEFCON suicide</a> card, but using it as an ABM Treaty doesn&#8217;t work any more.  You could conceivably use the 4 Ops of the card to repair the damage done by the USSR&#8217;s 4 Ops, but you&#8217;re still giving up 2 VP (not to mention raising DEFCON for the USSR&#8217;s next AR).</p>
