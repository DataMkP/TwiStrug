<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 1<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>In many ways this is similar to Allende, with sides reversed.  If the US is already in South America, then it&#8217;s not a big deal: maybe buff up Panama/Venezuela a little bit before playing this, or don&#8217;t even bother if the US already controls both of those countries.  (Who cares about Costa Rica?)</p>
<p>But if the US isn&#8217;t in South America, and especially if you don&#8217;t yet have the region locked down, this is hugely problematic.  You could theoretically use the 1 Op to realign the US out of Venezuela, but your odds of success are only <a href="http://twilightstrategy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ts-realignment-probability-charts.pdf">27.78%</a>.  A better use is often to headline Panama Canal Returned, and then try to coup Venezuela on AR1 (or, if you are concerned about the US dropping DEFCON in the headline, use the 1 Op of Panama Canal Returned on AR1 to coup Venezuela, but with only 1/2 chance of success).</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>I normally use this for the event only when I need to establish access to South America, though of course I will be careful to do so only at DEFCON 2.  It can also be useful as an <a title="General Strategy: The AR7 Play" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/03/15/general-strategy-ar7-plays/">AR7 play</a> to break USSR control of Venezuela or Panama (preferably both).</p>
