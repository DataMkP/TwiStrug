<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>The only reason you&#8217;d ever want to play this for the event is for VP; adding 1 influence into a 4-stability country is like drilling for oil with a toothpick, and you&#8217;d rarely want to realign, much less coup, West Germany anyway.</p>
<p>If France somehow is still empty on Turn 4, Willy Brandt makes a decent headline by &#8220;kicking down the door&#8221; to France and giving you access.  But you should have already gotten access to France, either by forcing your way into West Germany/Italy earlier, or <a title="Decolonization" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/04/05/decolonization/">Decolonizing</a> into Algeria.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>If you really, honestly, have nothing else to space, then you may as well space Willy Brandt.  Usually I&#8217;m more than happy to give the USSR a VP and play the 2 Ops, especially since I probably used <a title="Marshall Plan" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/03/16/marshall-plan/">Marshall Plan</a> to shore up West Germany a little.  If it hasn&#8217;t been triggered, then Willy Brandt is equivalent to a 1 Op if you use the other Op to repair West Germany.  But you don&#8217;t even really need to repair West Germany yet if Europe Scoring has come and gone.</p>
