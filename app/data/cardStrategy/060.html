<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>3 Ops is better than 1 VP, and still better than a chance at 2 VPs.  So unless you&#8217;re at -18 or -19VPs, play this for the Ops.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Play this for the Ops and don&#8217;t think twice about it, unless you&#8217;re at -19VPs, in which case space it, duh.</p>
<p><strong>Pedantical aside</strong></p>
<p>Much more interesting (to me, at least) is whether this card should be &#8220;U2 Incident&#8221; or &#8220;U-2 Incident&#8221;.  According to both the <a title="1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_United_States_Tri-Service_aircraft_designation_system">1962 United States Tri-Service military aircraft designation system</a> as well as the <a href="http://www.navy.mil/tools/styleguide_print.asp">U.S. Navy Style Guide</a>, military aircraft is always designated with a hyphen (e.g., U-2, F/A-18 <em>Hornet</em>, B-52 <em>Stratofortress</em>).  But in Twilight Struggle, both the card and the Player Aid Card List omit the hyphen. (Oddly enough, the historical notes at the end of the rulebook, as reprinted above, do include the hyphen.)</p>
<p>Of course, it is possible that the event is actually referring to an incident involving a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2">certain Irish rock band</a>, and the picture of the plane is just thrown in there to confuse us.</p>
