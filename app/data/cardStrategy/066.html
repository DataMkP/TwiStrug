<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Early in the Mid War, this is usually a must-space because it gives the US access to otherwise inaccessible battlegrounds (like a poor man&#8217;s De-Stalinization).</p>
<p>But even later in the Mid War, this is still a harsh event to deal with.  The US can use it to take a bunch of non-battlegrounds, thus limiting any possibility of you scoring Domination.  Worse, it&#8217;s never clear whether you should use the Ops before or after the event: if you use it after, then the US has more targets for the influence.  But if you use it before, you&#8217;re allowing them &#8220;consecutive actions&#8221; by letting the US drop 3 influence into countries like Colombia, Saharan States, or Nicaragua for realigns on their next action.</p>
<p>So I usually try to space it.  It&#8217;s fairly low on the priority list behind Grain Sales to Soviets and The Voice of America, of course, but I would rather the US play this event than I.  If I&#8217;m unable to space it, I try to make absolutely sure that there&#8217;s no semi-useful country out there for Puppet Governments (Afghanistan, Colombia) before playing it to coup back the most useful country that the US takes.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of De-Stalinization, except it gets pretty lame pretty quickly.  In fact, I find its efficacy is often directly correlated with whether Decolonization/De-Stalinization have been played.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m playing this for the event, it&#8217;s either because I can place the influence in otherwise-inaccessible battlegrounds (not Mexico), I have a plan that involves controlling multiple non-battlegrounds (i.e. a headline threatening AR1 realignment, or denying an Africa Domination), or sometimes both.</p>
<p>If the USSR triggers it and all the obvious spots are taken, some frequently-overlooked countries to drop influence into include Czechoslovakia, Peru, and Tunisia, all of which offer some less-common realignment possibilities.</p>
