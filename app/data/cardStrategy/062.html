<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>I usually try to keep this in the deck, especially if I&#8217;m not doing well as the USSR.  But it does make for a decent headline, especially if you draw this on Turn 7 or later and there&#8217;s no way it would end up in the US hand anyway.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always lovely when the US is forced to headline this event, especially since you can either use the 1 Op for influence or realignments, and then coup with a bigger card on AR1, or just coup with it in the headline to avoid NORAD.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Lone Gunman is in general the most painful DEFCON degrader in the game.  You can&#8217;t space it, like with We Will Bury You.  You can&#8217;t match it up with Containment, which should usually get triggered in the Early War.  It&#8217;s worse than its counterpart CIA Created because you&#8217;ll always have influence to target with it, and you can&#8217;t play it on AR1.</p>
<p>So unless you headline it, you&#8217;ll almost never get a chance to get rid of this DEFCON suicide card.  The general DEFCON article discusses in greater detail how to deal with cards like these, so I will just make a few particular notes:</p>
<p>One unusual way to escape Lone Gunman, if you can&#8217;t hold a card to next turn, is to Quagmire yourself on the second-to-last turn holding just Lone Gunman.  As you can&#8217;t discard Lone Gunman, you just skip your Action Round and get to hold it to next turn.  Obviously not ideal, but still preferable to DEFCON suicide.</p>
<p>I generally hold Lone Gunman turn to turn until I find some way to get rid of it.  The alternative is just to bite the bullet and headline it, but the problem, of course, is that Lone Gunman causes maximum hurt in the headline phase and can still lose you the game if the USSR headlines a DEFCON degrader.  (Usually the USSR doesn&#8217;t, though, since they intend to coup, but NORAD changes this dynamic somewhat.)</p>
<p>However, if you are forced to lose a card, via Blockade, Aldrich Ames Remix, or Terrorism, holding Lone Gunman basically loses you the game if you can&#8217;t raise DEFCON or play the China Card.  So if you are threatened by any of those and lack the China Card, you are basically forced to headline Lone Gunman rather than risk the loss.</p>
<p>Finally, never give up just because you realize you are stuck with Lone Gunman!  There is always the chance that the last USSR play will be Ask Not &#8230;</p>
