<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 4<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p>One of the Big Three Mid War neutral events, along with <a title="Brush War" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/09/04/brush-war/">Brush War</a> and <a title="Junta" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/10/01/junta/">Junta</a>, and easily one of the best events in the game.</p>
<p>Its most common use is as a free 4 Ops coup after DEFCON drops to 2.  (Somewhat ironic that an anti-ballistic missile treaty is intended to launch coups, but that&#8217;s Cold War logic for you I suppose.)  This is a pretty self-explanatory way to dramatically alter the dynamics of <a title="Regions: South America" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/08/15/regions-south-america/">South America</a> or <a title="Regions: Central America" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/09/04/regions-central-america/">Central America</a>, and more rarely a way to really, <em>really</em> lock up an African battleground.  For the US, they get a small bonus here with <a title="NORAD" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/07/25/norad/">NORAD</a>.</p>
<p>You can also headline this to conduct operations in the headline.  Headlining it (or playing it on AR1, as USSR) gives you the chance to perform the rare Asia coup, possibly flipping Thailand or Pakistan.</p>
<p>Of course, being able to conduct operations in the headline is an all-around useful tactic.  The US can perform the SALT-ABM trick: use <a title="SALT Negotiations" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/09/17/salt-negotiations/">SALT Negotiations</a> to reclaim ABM Treaty to your hand at the end of the turn, pushing DEFCON up two levels.  Then as DEFCON rises to 5 next turn, you headline ABM Treaty and get to conduct operations in Europe in the headline phase: typically a series of realignments, though occasionally you might see an Italy coup.  The USSR can do this too, but it&#8217;s a little bit trickier: first, you&#8217;re giving the US a free (albeit -1) battleground coup on AR7; second, the US might headline <a title="Defectors" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/07/09/defectors/">Defectors</a>; third, a US 4 Ops headline would trigger before yours.  The US faces none of these problems.</p>
