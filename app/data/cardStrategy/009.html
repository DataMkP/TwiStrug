<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>This card starts off very strong and quickly becomes worse and worse as the game goes on.  On <a title="General Strategy: Turn 1" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/general-strategy-turn-1/">Turn 1</a>, before <a title="Battlegrounds: Thailand" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/battlegrounds-thailand/">Thailand</a> has been claimed, this is a superb headline and an easy way to grab the crucial battleground.  By Turn 3, or worse, the Mid War, your attention is probably elsewhere, since the US will probably already have taken Thailand.  If the US hasn&#8217;t overcontrolled Thailand because you don&#8217;t have access to it, this can be a nice way to sneak into Thailand with the China Card.</p>
<p>The bonus to Operations is quite nice, though there aren&#8217;t really that many ways to spend all those Operations in Southeast Asia, since you&#8217;ll rarely venture south of Thailand.  It does mean that if you plan on playing the card during the turn, you should headline it for maximum benefit.  It&#8217;s a good headline candidate because it&#8217;s strong enough to be meaningful, but it&#8217;s not the end of the world if it runs into Defectors.</p>
<p><em>Riku Riekkinen&#8217;s thoughts:</em></p>
<p>Vietnam Revolts is a very good headline, because it allows the USSR to instantly dominate Asia (in case the US tries to dump Asia Scoring on the headline).</p>
<p>There are 4 camps regarding headlining Vietnam Revolts on Turn 1:</p>
<p>1) Don&#8217;t do that.  Wait until DEFCON is 3, so that US can&#8217;t coup you out of there.  This might cost you Thailand, depending on whether the US is already in Malaysia when you play Vietnam Revolts.  You might still be able to flip Thailand with your +1 Ops and China Card, however.</p>
<p>2) Headline it and coup Iran AR1.  Now US can start a coup-counter coup routine in Vietnam, but it&#8217;s couping at a disadvantage due to Vietnam Revolts&#8217; +1.  So the US is really looking to empty out Vietnam with a coup, which it has a 1/6 chance of doing so on each roll.</p>
<p>3) Headline it and play into Thailand &amp; Laos/Cambodia. Now, if the US coups Thailand, you can coup it back at +1.  Even if the US empties Thailand, preventing you from counter-couping, you still have backup countries in Southeast Asia and can retake Thailand before the US.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s generally agreed that couping Iran is the best move for USSR on Turn 1 AR1. However, if you&#8217;re playing with influence bids for the US, Iran is sometimes overcontrolled so heavily that couping Iran is no longer worthwhile.  This Vietnam Revolts headline play is a strong alternative, and probably much better than Socialist Governments &amp; Italy.</p>
<p>4) Headline it and play Asia scoring on AR1, scoring a quick and dirty Domination.  Probably the worst of these options, but a possibility if you have a truly, truly terrible hand (e.g., nothing but 1 Ops after a Red Purge/Scare headline).</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>Completely harmless if played on the final Action Round, so long as you make sure you already took Thailand (and possibly Laos/Cambodia).  This card is a good reason not to play into Vietnam unless you need the country immediately for <a title="Regions: Asia" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/14/regions-asia/">Asia Scoring</a> or Southeast Asia Scoring.</p>
