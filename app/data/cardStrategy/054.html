<p>If you haven&#8217;t made it into South America, then Allende is great, obviously, but beware getting wiped out by realignment.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re already in South America, then Allende is rarely helpful unless you really need 2 influence in Chile right now.  Better to just let it come back in the Late War.</p>
<p>When taking over South America, I usually take over Chile last, because maybe the US has to play Allende for me.  But as soon as I suspect the scoring card is coming, I take Chile rather than miss out on Control or Domination because I was too cheap to spend two influence.</p>
<p>Similarly, if I need to establish access to South America via coup, I usually coup Venezuela/Brazil, because I might eventually gain access to Chile via Allende and Argentina via The Iron Lady.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>The easiest way of dealing with Allende is to overcontrol Chile first and then use Allende&#8217;s 1 Op to repair the damage.  If the USSR doesn&#8217;t have access into South America, then the best way of dealing with Allende is usually via realignment: take Peru and Argentina, then realign away the two USSR influence.</p>
<p>The worst situation is when neither of you are in South America: you&#8217;ll just have to hold Allende for a long time.  If forced to play it, your best bet is to still try to realign Chile, with <a href="http://twilightstrategy.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ts-realignment-probability-charts.pdf">1/6 odds</a> of knocking the USSR out entirely.</p>
