<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Our Man in Tehran hovers just at the border of send-to-space and suck-it-up.  If I can spare the Ops, I like to send it to space, but I rarely can, and so I often just end up playing it and hoping the US doesn&#8217;t find anything good.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve already seen the important cards (good scoring cards or good USSR events like Lone Gunman, We Will Bury You, Decolonization, Muslim Revolution, OPEC, etc.) go to the discard, then it&#8217;s not a big deal.  It&#8217;s also not a big deal in the rare situation where the US controls no Middle East country, or only controls a single one (and you can use the Ops to break control of the country).  And although it is slightly less effective on Turn 6 then at other times, that alone is not enough reason to feel safe about playing it.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A very nice event and one I almost always trigger.  It is worst on Turn 6, but even then it is better than its 2 Ops, especially if you have not yet seen an important card you wish to discard.</p>
