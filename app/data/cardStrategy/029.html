<p><strong>Time:</strong> Early War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>In the Early War and Mid War, this is generally at worst an empty Action Round and nothing more.  If under Red Purge, then it&#8217;s slightly worse than an empty Action Round, but the only two countries that really matter to you in Eastern Europe should be East Germany and Poland.</p>
<p>Much as the threat of a Socialist Governments headline forces the US to slightly overprotect its Western European battlegrounds, so too does East European Unrest force the USSR to overprotect its battlegrounds, as otherwise an EEU headline would be quite awkward for the USSR.  And if you&#8217;ve overprotected the two battlegrounds enough (or Comecon / Warsaw Pact did it for you), then this isn&#8217;t even an empty Action Round, and you can freely spend the Ops elsewhere.  Think of it as transferring 3 Ops from Eastern Europe to somewhere else.</p>
<p>In the Late War, this card is absolutely miserable.  Losing 4 Influence from East Germany / Poland simultaneously, right as you&#8217;re being hit with Chernobyl / Tear Down This Wall / Solidarity, can be brutal.  It&#8217;s not quite as bad as the others, but it&#8217;s a good candidate for the Space Race.  Be glad you drew it and not the US.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>In the Early War and Mid War, you usually have something better to do than remove from 3 Influence from overprotected or irrelevant countries.  It can be a decent headline (threatening Europe Scoring on AR1) or AR7 play, but usually the USSR has overprotected East Germany and Poland enough that there&#8217;s not much point to it.</p>
<p>In the Late War, this card is an absolute monster.  Combined with all the other pro-US Europe cards, being able to delete two influence from East Germany and Poland simultaneously is huge.  It&#8217;s more than just a 4Ops equivalent: its real use is to break USSR control of the two countries, allowing you to pour in influence without paying the 2-for-1 penalty.  Coupled with Chernobyl, it opens the floodgates to the Late War American takeover of Europe.  If you draw it on Turn 7, do everything in your power to hold it until next turn.</p>
