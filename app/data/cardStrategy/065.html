<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>An event on the border between spacing and not spacing: none of the effects by themselves are particularly harmful, but the combination of all three is a little bit irritating.  The influence is often not worth repairing: Sadat Expels Soviets will likely undo all the work you&#8217;ve done in Egypt.  But Camp David Accords gives the US halfway to control, and Sadat takes them the rest of the way.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A nice event, and one I try to trigger.  It is especially nice when you have no influence in Egypt, since then Sadat Expels Soviets will give you Egypt instead of just putting it to 1/0.  Cancelling Arab-Israeli War is a small bonus, and 1 VP is 1 VP.</p>
