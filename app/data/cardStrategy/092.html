<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> No</p>
<p>A fine little event.  At this stage of the game, 2 Ops is not a big deal compared to the possibility of an instant win (by forcing your opponent to now play a card he had planned to hold to next turn).  It is especially strong if your opponent does not have the <a title="The China Card" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/10/31/the-china-card/">China Card</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, you might hit a card you wish your opponent had held onto, but on balance, discarding cards from your opponent&#8217;s hand is a good thing.  You could compromise and at least be careful about playing Terrorism when your opponent could have a scoring card favorable to you.</p>
<p>Terrorism works best when you combine it with other hand-reducers like <a title="Five Year Plan" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2011/12/12/five-year-plan/">Five Year Plan</a>, <a title="Grain Sales to Soviets" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/11/07/grain-sales-to-soviets/">Grain Sales to Soviets</a>, or Aldrich Ames Remix.  Losing two cards is much more painful than losing one, since you can no longer hold a card even if you have the China Card, and moreover, you might have to skip your AR7 for lack of cards.  Accordingly, as USSR, this is an outstanding event if Iranian Hostage Crisis has been played, one I almost always trigger.</p>
<p>I tend to play this relatively early in the turn (often on the headline), before my opponent has gone to the Space Race, thus minimizing the chance that I force my opponent to discard a card he was going to hold or Space anyway.  Terrorism can also be good as your last play if you suspect that the other side is up to something (especially against the US on Turn 10).</p>
<p>Holding the China Card and playing <a title="SALT Negotiations" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/09/17/salt-negotiations/">SALT Negotiations</a> are both decent counters to Terrorism by restoring your hand size.</p>
