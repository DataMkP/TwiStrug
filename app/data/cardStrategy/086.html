<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> US<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>I try to save North Sea Oil for the end of the Turn, to reduce the time the US has to prepare for an AR8.  It&#8217;s not generally worth sending to space, except on Turn 10, where an AR8 is especially uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The event is a lot less threatening when the US does not have the China Card and you&#8217;re able to use Aldrich Ames Remix and/or Terrorism to cut the US hand size.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>North Sea Oil probably makes most sense as a headline, but in a pinch you could play it during the turn.  The point is to give up one of your regular Action Rounds (or headline) and 3 Ops in exchange for two consecutive Action Rounds at the end of the turn, which can be used for all kinds of nefarious purposes.  The <a title="OPEC" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/10/29/opec/">OPEC</a> block is just a nice bonus.</p>
<p>It is naturally most effective on Turn 10.  It also tends to be better when you have the <a title="The China Card" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/10/31/the-china-card/">China Card</a> or <a title="SALT Negotiations" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/09/17/salt-negotiations/">SALT Negotiations</a>, both of which would allow you to hold an extra card so you don&#8217;t have to play every card in your hand.</p>
<p>In the Late War, I try (if reasonable) to not hold a problematic card and space it earlier in the turn instead.  This allows me to take advantage of a USSR AR7 play of North Sea Oil.  (Reminiscent of the US approach to a possible USSR <a title="Containment" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/03/20/containment/">Containment</a> in the Early War.)</p>
