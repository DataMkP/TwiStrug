<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>One of the best (and most underrated) USSR events.  Launching two simultaneous coups allows you to set up countries for realignments, defend against US <a title="General Strategy: The AR7 Play" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/03/15/general-strategy-ar7-plays/">AR7 moves</a>, or threaten multiple countries at once.  Consecutive Action Rounds are one of the holy grails of Twilight Struggle, and Che comes close.</p>
<p>The best use of Che comes when you can make two threats and the US can only respond to one.  Most non-battleground countries are valuable for their connection to a battleground, and sometimes the only response to an attack on a non-battleground is to coup it back.  When you identify two such non-battlegrounds, take advantage of the opportunity to double coup.  Now the US must choose one non-battleground to respond in, and you are free to leverage the other non-battleground against an adjacent battleground (either by direct influence placement or realignment).</p>
<p>Che gets better as the game goes on and more influence is invested into non-battlegrounds.  Most games tend to have a pattern of low investment into non-battlegrounds (out of fear of being couped out), followed by rapid investment into non-battlegrounds (where there is no longer enough &#8220;time&#8221; / Action Rounds to coup them all back efficiently).  It is in that later stage that Che becomes so powerful.</p>
<p>The fact that Che earns you Mil Ops (unlike <a title="Junta" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/10/01/junta/">Junta</a>) is just icing on the cake.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have any targets (or only one target), it&#8217;s a relatively safe play, particularly since you can coup back whatever Che coups.  It&#8217;s also safe if your non-battlegrounds are 3-stability (i.e., Costa Rica).  But once you get into the stage of owning many non-battlegrounds, as described above, Che is too dangerous to play (it is equivalent to 6 Ops for the USSR!) and better off sent to space.</p>
