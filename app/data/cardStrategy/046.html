<p><strong>Time:</strong> Mid War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> Neutral<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 2<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p>A straightforward way to manipulate DEFCON, so it works in all the situations you&#8217;d expect: DEFCON-suicide cards, situations where your opponent can&#8217;t coup due to Quagmire/Bear Trap or Cuban Missile Crisis, etc.</p>
<p>Like other DEFCON degraders, it&#8217;s also useful as a headline trap, since if your opponent&#8217;s headline degrades DEFCON and is subsequent to yours, you instantly win.  (One advantage HILTSW holds over headlining other DEFCON degraders is that it can&#8217;t backfire if your opponent also tries to lower DEFCON in the headline.)</p>
<p>The Mil Ops is what really sets this card apart: it means you can headline it to prevent battleground coups, but also earn your Mil Ops VPs at the end of the turn.  In addition, it gives the US a little trick on the last Action Round: use How I Learned to Stop Worrying to set DEFCON to 5, meaning instead of losing 2 VP to Mil Ops requirements, you can force the USSR to lose up to 3 VP to Mil Ops.</p>
<p>So, like most Mid War cards, this one tilts slightly to the US, who often needs both DEFCON at 2 and Mil Ops more than the USSR does.  But the USSR can get good value out of it as a DEFCON raiser: if they headline the card, they might be able to raise DEFCON to 4 or 5 and be able to coup Asia / realign Europe on AR1.</p>
