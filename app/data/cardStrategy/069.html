<p>A somewhat speculative headline, Latin American Death Squads is most useful when engaged in a battle for Central America (as the coup targets are better than in South America).  It can also be used as a prophylactic defense for one of your battlegrounds in case your opponent gets the battleground coup.</p>
<p>The main limit to its usefulness is that you don&#8217;t really need that many non-battleground coups.  Therefore, events that allow more battleground coups by either side (SALT Negotiations, How I Learned to Stop Worrying, ABM Treaty, Nuclear Subs, etc.) all make LADS more useful, provided that South America/Central America is yet to be scored.</p>
