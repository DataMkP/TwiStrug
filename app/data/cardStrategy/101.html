<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Assuming that John Paul II has been elected Pope, then Solidarity falls into the &#8220;empty action round&#8221; category of US events; it&#8217;s worth sending to space, but you can also just repair its damage (assuming you&#8217;ve overprotected Poland).</p>
<p>The main drawback of repairing rather than spacing is that it makes you more vulnerable to <a title="East European Unrest" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/04/02/east-european-unrest/">East European Unrest</a>: if the US only has their <a title="John Paul II Elected Pope" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/11/08/john-paul-ii-elected-pope/">John Paul II Elected Pope</a> influence in Poland, then EEU can&#8217;t grant them control no matter how many times they play it.</p>
<p>The main advantage of playing it for Ops is that you might be able to later use <a title="Warsaw Pact Formed" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/02/20/warsaw-pact-formed/">Warsaw Pact Formed</a> to more efficiently purge eastern Europe of all US influence.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is annoying no matter what to draw Solidarity, which is even further reason to send John Paul II to space if you draw it.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>A fine event, suitable for AR7 or headline, especially if you can combo it with <a title="Truman Doctrine" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/03/02/truman-doctrine/">Truman Doctrine</a> or some other Europe-affecting event (<a title="Chernobyl" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/12/18/chernobyl/">Chernobyl</a>, East European Unrest, etc.).  It even works well with <a title="Tear Down This Wall" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/12/20/tear-down-this-wall/">Tear Down This Wall</a> by potentially removing a USSR modifier on East Germany realignments.  And as noted earlier, Solidarity is a great way to establish enough influence in Poland so that a subsequent East European Unrest can grant you control.</p>
<p>I do always try to play John Paul II for the event; even if I don&#8217;t draw Solidarity later, or don&#8217;t intend to contest Poland, it&#8217;s still nice to leave a strong US event in the deck.</p>
