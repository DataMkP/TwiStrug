<p><strong>Time:</strong> Late War<br />
<strong>Side:</strong> USSR<br />
<strong>Ops:</strong> 3<br />
<strong>Removed after event:</strong> Yes</p>
<p><strong>As USSR</strong></p>
<p>Like a much weaker Socialist Governments, except with a 1 VP bonus and not cancellable by <a title="The Iron Lady" href="http://twilightstrategy.com/2012/12/03/the-iron-lady/">The Iron Lady</a>.  It is worth playing if the VP matters for Wargames or if the influence loss affects scoring.  A decent headline in the Late War.</p>
<p><strong>As US</strong></p>
<p>If your European countries are overcontrolled (and you have nothing to fear from the event), then it&#8217;s often worth losing a VP to have 3 Ops.  But if you&#8217;re just going to spend your Action Round repairing the damage done by the event, you may as well send this to space and save the VP.</p>
